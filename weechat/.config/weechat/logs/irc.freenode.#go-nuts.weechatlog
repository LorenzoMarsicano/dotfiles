2019-09-13 14:35:37	Stealthy	thats why i didnt want to go into irrelevant details :p
2019-09-13 14:35:40	A_D	Start by not using bigint.
2019-09-13 14:35:54	A_D	Then parallelise.
2019-09-13 14:36:07	A_D	But again
2019-09-13 14:36:08	lluad	Stealthy there are faster approaches. None of them are usefully faster. Assume yuor CPU is slower than 10Ghz, so can't do more than 10^10 operations a second. Do the arithmetic to see how long it'll take to do 2^256 operations.
2019-09-13 14:36:08	siXy	A_D: You're overstating the case a bit. A good implementation on a recent GPU can do over 5000 million sha256 hashes per second, which is plenty to make bruteforcing a reasonable search space affordable.
2019-09-13 14:36:30	A_D	siXy: I'm assuming they want to brute all of it
2019-09-13 14:36:35	A_D	given their proposed code
2019-09-13 14:36:41	siXy	Stealthy: Again, you are not going to be able to do this. You can't crack hashes on CPUs usefully.
2019-09-13 14:36:52	Stealthy	if you want to go the cuda route then good luck there is no quick sha256 library you can abuse
2019-09-13 14:36:57	siXy	Stealthy: Download and use oclhashcat. Solved.

2019-09-13 14:51:26	Stealthy	is there are a proper way to time elapsed without being too much of an impact performance wise
2019-09-13 14:51:36	A_D	Yes. use time.time.
2019-09-13 14:51:39	A_D	printing is SLOW
2019-09-13 14:51:45	A_D	horridly slow
2019-09-13 14:51:53	Stealthy	ya
2019-09-13 14:52:07	Stealthy	only reason a print was in there was to see/show
2019-09-13 14:52:11	Stealthy	it'll be gone from the logic
2019-09-13 14:52:43	Stealthy	thanks siXy will use profiling for sure
2019-09-13 14:53:15	Stealthy	coffee almost finished then i'll come up with a 4x int64 approach
2019-09-13 14:53:36	A_D	for printing, look at the select in line 127 here: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/Rbdkx5YqM5/
2019-09-13 14:53:51	siXy	(side note: my figures were apparently out of date and current GPUs will do about 7.5 billion hashes per second, per GPU.
2019-09-13 14:54:02	A_D	7.5? fuck thats quick

2019-09-13 15:00:24	lluad	SHA256 is a 256 bit / 32 byte hash. Given Stealthy's code had 64 hex digits, I'm assuming that's it.

2019-09-13 15:02:11	Stealthy	hehe
2019-09-13 15:02:14	A_D	sure, just mine all the silicon in this solar system
2019-09-13 15:02:15	Stealthy	only if you know the 2nd item
2019-09-13 15:02:18	A_D	and the one next door
2019-09-13 15:02:24	Stealthy	but what if you only had a 5th millionth key
2019-09-13 15:02:25	Stealthy	;)
2019-09-13 15:02:35	A_D	no, thats to brute force every hash in 256
2019-09-13 15:02:36	siXy	Powering them would be an exciting engineering challenge, too.
2019-09-13 15:02:40	Stealthy	you would need to recreate a hash chain from an assumed master key
2019-09-13 15:02:48	A_D	oh well you destroyed the solar systems anyway siXy
2019-09-13 15:02:55	A_D	may as well dyson sphere the stars
2019-09-13 15:03:01	siXy	I'll have to move nextdoor at this rate
2019-09-13 15:03:10	Stealthy	so for every iteration of an assumed master key you'd need to generate a hash chain to see if it comes up with one of the known hashes
2019-09-13 15:03:35	Stealthy	that's 5 million of hashes for every iteration of a starting hash
2019-09-13 15:03:44	lluad	(2^256 ~= 10^75. There are ~ 10^8 seconds in a year. So at 10GHz it'd take ~ 10^65 seconds, or ~ 10^58 years to walk the entire space.
2019-09-13 15:03:48	Stealthy	i never had the illusion that i'll get the actual match
2019-09-13 15:04:28	Stealthy	thats a guestimate
2019-09-13 15:04:49	A_D	a very good one

2019-09-13 15:05:22	A_D	I'd cut that in half to get what it'll probably take
2019-09-13 15:05:23	Stealthy	if you want to go more specific i can tell you the fastest intel docs can produce a 512 bit hash in 10 cycles
2019-09-13 15:05:28	A_D	give or take a thousand years

2019-09-13 17:22:16	A_D	the lang reference may be a bit faster for you to lookup then?
2019-09-13 17:22:31	A_D	https://golang.org/ref/spec its pretty small and has a nice index at the top
2019-09-13 17:23:01	A_D	also if you're coming from C, one thing that you may like/hate if you did not know: pointer resolution is usually done automatically for you

2019-09-13 17:25:46	Tv`	vulpix1337: in Go, C's "." and "->" operators are both spelled "."
2019-09-13 17:25:47	Stealthy	also in my case the bigint string can be slow; its the subroutine that has to be fast
2019-09-13 17:26:13	A_D	Tv`: thanks >.>
2019-09-13 17:26:15	Stealthy	a subroutine makes 10 million hashes based upon the one hash passed from the slow loop
2019-09-13 17:27:12	vulpix1337	Tv`: ahhh interesting
2019-09-13 17:27:50	Stealthy	with my cpu i can at max run 8 threads of these subroutines and thats where optimization can make an impact, not in main or on the slow string
2019-09-13 17:28:50	Stealthy	and these subroutines work with a byte (copy) of that slow string; its taken as the input for sha256 and outputs directly to the same byte array for the next iteration
2019-09-13 17:29:07	Stealthy	i dont see how a pool (or anything at this point) can make it quicker
2019-09-13 17:29:26	Stealthy	i even took the recreation of sha256 out and just write the buffer, calc sum

2019-09-13 17:30:47	A_D	Next step would be reading up on arrays vs slices and how slice growth works, I think

2019-09-13 17:31:48	Stealthy	i've been introduced with slices in JS but im not sure how it'll make my case quicker

2019-10-17 14:57:26	amitizle	Hey all, more of a style question: are you waiting for external services (external to your go app) to be ready on boot/periodically? Like Redis, DB etc. If so, how are you implementing it?

2019-10-17 15:00:31	ezdiy	ie if its a web app, it "hangs" until db connects, or just straight spits error message if the connection failures propagate
2019-10-17 15:01:39	amitizle	Cool, thanks, and how are you managing the queued requests? I mean do you have any specific cutoff where you just drop the requests?

2019-10-17 15:03:05	ezdiy	yes, usually there's a cutoff when the queue overflows, or the backoff goes up to some threshold

2019-10-17 17:36:00	lupine	yeah, that's the thing. one of my tests is using a HTTP socket, the other a fake reader that is uninterruptible. one test is good, the other bad.

2019-10-17 17:43:11	Tv`	the original question was about reading Request.Body though

2019-10-17 17:45:23	Tv`	and relying on body ending with error shortly after the handler panics is also not documented, but at least it sounds reasonable
2019-10-17 17:46:58	Tv`	cue brad's blue sky ng rewrite...

2019-10-18 13:13:13	godefrey	so my question is whether it's idiomatic (or not idiomatic) to form such groups and what appearance they should have

2019-10-18 13:13:47	godefrey	if you have any references that can answer that (sztanpet?)

2019-10-18 13:14:25	sztanpet	godefrey dunno, both sublime and vscode do the groupings and ordering for me, so i dont have to care

2019-10-21 15:47:46	nil	hi! go allows the user to omit semicolons and use newlines instead in some places, and this seems to be done by "automatically inserting" a semicolon at the end of the line during lexical analysis, given some condition on the last token parsed (see https://golang.org/ref/spec#Semicolons)

2019-10-21 15:57:48	lpapp|win	I would rather develop in go cygwin agnostic
2019-10-21 15:58:04	Wessie	so /cygdrive/c/Projects/Go
2019-10-21 15:58:31	lpapp|win	I hope the two git installations will not clash
2019-10-21 15:58:42	lpapp|win	not sure why cygwin cannot get it from a more systematic path though
2019-10-21 15:58:46	lpapp|win	why it has to be inside

2019-10-21 15:59:41	Wessie	been a while since I used cygwin, but I believe programs are compiled without knowledge that they're on windows, so a windows path just looks like a filename to them
2019-10-21 16:00:05	lpapp|win	old school docker :P
2019-10-21 16:00:53	icholy	in that they both suck?
2019-10-21 16:01:00	lpapp|win	lol
2019-10-21 16:01:13	lpapp|win	I do not know why anyone would use cygwin these days
2019-10-21 16:01:20	lpapp|win	but then the same goes to cvs they use
2019-10-21 16:01:41	lpapp|win	anyway, the system-wide git installation is the second in the output of where git
2019-10-21 16:01:43	icholy	WSL has replaced most uses for cygwin AFAIK
2019-10-21 16:01:52	lpapp|win	and which git still says: /usr/bin/git
2019-10-21 16:02:09	Wessie	that or msys yeah, works a lot smoother

2019-10-21 16:03:08	lpapp|win	so, what setup should I do to make it work for both of us
2019-10-21 16:03:31	Wessie	as suggested earlier, just swapping the GOPATH might just work
2019-10-21 16:03:50	lpapp|win	yeah, but that does not work if cygwin gets removed ...
2019-10-21 16:04:16	Wessie	they would have a missing git at that point
2019-10-21 16:04:25	icholy	lpapp|win: change the windows PATH to have the system wide git first
2019-10-21 16:04:29	lpapp|win	well, they would have the system-wide
2019-10-21 16:04:42	lpapp|win	can the system-wide git installation be prioritised outside cygwin, but not inside?
2019-10-21 16:04:55	lpapp|win	icholy, would that break inside cygwin?

2019-10-22 17:05:16	siXy	smw: The fmt.Fprint(h, ...) should do that.
2019-10-22 17:05:30	guido_g	see fmt.Fprint, the hash is written to

2019-10-22 17:06:58	guido_g	and that raises the question if not one of the faster hashes is better suited
2019-10-22 17:07:25	+smw	siXy, woops...

2019-10-22 17:08:14	+smw	icholy, "Hash is used to identify existing stores with the same options", that means security. Use sha256 or something :-)
2019-10-22 17:08:52	+smw	icholy, I take that back. if you plan to do a complete equality test after, then it isn't for security
2019-10-22 17:09:31	icholy	smw: yeah, the hash is used for the directory name and then there's a file inside will the full fidelity info (as json)
2019-10-22 17:09:31	siXy	icholy: In that case I'd do what you're doing now but either use a non-cryptographic hash like fingerprint2011 or a modern crypto hash like sha256.  using sha1 in new code today raises eyebrows and there's no good reason for it.
2019-10-22 17:09:32	icholy	with*
2019-10-22 17:10:29	siXy	unless you're doing this over hundreds of thousands of things, I'd opt for the latter and go with sha256 - it's safer and you don't need to think about side effects
2019-10-22 17:10:43	albertito	icholy: you need to be careful when doing things like that because, in addition to the choice of hashing, how you serialize the data matters

2019-10-22 17:25:18	Tv`	my rule of thumb is, never pretend to hash anything that isn't []byte -- so if this is about deduplicating things stored in something, first marshal it, then dedup on the []byte (with a hash of the byte sequence)
2019-10-22 17:25:52	Tv`	also, if this is inmemory, a go map can use Options as the key type just fine

2019-10-24 12:04:20	BeerLover	I wanted to know how I can implement data structures in Go with generic types. I have been solving Leetcode problems and from time to time I have to implement data structures for various types int, floats etc. Is there a way? For example, https://play.golang.org/p/GBy0inCJO3U
2019-10-24 12:04:36	BeerLover	here I implemented Heap - min and max for Ints

2019-10-24 12:06:46	BeerLover	How would I go about using interfaces for this example?
2019-10-24 12:07:24	BeerLover	I have been feeling that Go doesn't facilitate code reuse that much.
2019-10-24 12:07:54	bookworm	no it doesn't
2019-10-24 12:08:35	velco	not *that* form of code reuse
2019-10-24 12:08:46	bookworm	for the built-in types you can't use interfaces (at least the basic ones like int or bool)
2019-10-24 12:09:02	velco	bookworm, what do you mean ?
2019-10-24 12:09:19	bookworm	>> How would I go about using interfaces for this example?
2019-10-24 12:09:31	bookworm	example being min / max
2019-10-24 12:10:03	bookworm	which you can't do say for int / uint / int32 etc
2019-10-24 12:10:19	bookworm	as you can't put methods on those types
2019-10-24 12:11:18	velco	" you can't put methods on those types" is very different from "for the built-in types you can't use interfaces (at least the basic ones like int or bool)"

Interfaces solve a different problem to generics - if you have a walk through tour.golang.org that will get you started with how they work and what they're for.

2019-10-24 17:09:04	seebs	"minimal" is almost certainly "just stdlib", since presumably the existence of the packages shows that it's possible to do the thing using stdlib. :P
2019-10-24 17:11:42	seebs	(with a handful of exceptions, like stuff using OpenGL)
2019-10-24 17:13:47	siXy	afidegnum: One reason you may feel like you get less help here than you may prefer is the insistence on using frameworks like chi - they're extremely unpopular here, for good reasons - they obscure what's really happening and are usually not needed. If you were to re-write this without all the chi stuff, without cors, etc you'd probably not only find your life easier, but you'd get more support too.
2019-10-24 17:14:54	siXy	If your code is just bolting together various 3rd party frameworks of variable quality to help you we need to spend a bunch of effort figuring out what those frameworks do, unless you're lucky enough to find someone that's used that specific combination and has time/inclination to help. The odds of this are not high, especially here.

2019-10-24 17:49:06	Zunino	I'm having trouble understanding how to create and use modules properly. This is a basic project structure I created: https://pastebin.com/krBtKnj4
2019-10-24 17:49:16	Tv`	somebody didn't get the memo about what testing is meant to do... https://github.com/mdp/qrterminal/blob/master/qrterminal_test.go
2019-10-24 17:49:31	Zunino	Basically, I wrote a small "lib" and would like to use it from main.go, a test program.
2019-10-24 17:49:52	Zunino	But, as you can see, go run complains about being unable to find the module.
2019-10-24 17:49:52	Tv`	Zunino: you most likely want just one top-level go.mod
2019-10-24 17:50:26	Zunino	Tv`: Tried it before. But IIRC, there was an error about having more than a package in the same dir.
2019-10-24 17:50:33	Tv`	that's unrelated...

2019-10-25 11:51:37	Shrike	having a select isn't forced, you just need to keep checking up whether the context is done during the function

2019-10-25 11:52:00	Shrike	but if it's a loop of a bunch of smaller operations, then it's really easy

2019-10-25 11:52:26	nindustries	wonder how sql does it
2019-10-25 11:52:43	Shrike	you can't cancel in the middle of a large operation
2019-10-25 11:52:54	Shrike	the operation might return, but it's still running on the DB server

2019-10-25 12:59:13	afidegnum	hello, i m reading about pointers again, i have some pertinent question, why do we append * to have the value of the address of a variable when a normal variable assignment could also work? here is an example
2019-10-25 12:59:26	afidegnum	https://play.golang.com/p/NGJoniCosbA
2019-10-25 12:59:44	Tichodroma	define "work"
2019-10-25 13:00:12	Tichodroma	also "car c int = &b" is not valid
2019-10-25 13:00:13	afidegnum	i mean using a normal variable is also able to print the address of the related variable
2019-10-25 13:00:35	afidegnum	sorry, it's a typo
2019-10-25 13:01:09	Tichodroma	can you fix so it runs?
2019-10-25 13:01:22	afidegnum	ah, why the compiler didn't give an earlier error
2019-10-25 13:01:28	afidegnum	do we have car in golang ?
2019-10-25 13:01:38	Tichodroma	?
2019-10-25 13:01:43	Zigara	even if you fix car -> var it still won't work
2019-10-25 13:01:53	Tichodroma	^ +1
2019-10-25 13:02:00	velco	afidegnum, no matter what you have pointER value and pointED value; you need to tell which one to use
2019-10-25 13:02:17	siXy	afidegnum: Do you know what pointers actually are?
2019-10-25 13:02:26	afidegnum	ok, i got it, & is a type *int
2019-10-25 13:03:22	siXy	afidegnum: I think you should do some more reading, perhaps using this as a starting point: https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/8
2019-10-25 13:03:28	afidegnum	Zigara: yes, it didn't
2019-10-25 13:03:33	siXy	There are some fundamental concepts you appear to be missing
2019-10-25 13:03:54	afidegnum	siXy: i have been reading a lots about pointers, i m revising the concepts again,

2019-10-25 15:50:54	mlk	Hi folks, I want to make a request to a url that'll respond with a pretty big json doc. I want to start reading it ASAP, even before it's complete, so that I can call a go routine with something I expect to be at the start of said json doc. Is there a way of doing so?
2019-10-25 15:50:55	snappy	i feel like i've asked this before - but i keep doing the same thing over and over again; when using GOPATH can you use git worktrees? A git worktree is basically a directory dedicated to a git branch in your tree; it allows you to swap branches by simply changing directory into the appropriate worktree.
2019-10-25 15:51:15	snappy	It seems vendor doesn't play well with it.
2019-10-25 15:52:03	snappy	mlk: can you wrap this in an io.Reader style interface?
2019-10-25 15:52:28	mlk	I'm very new at go, that question went over my head
2019-10-25 15:53:29	siXy	mlk: How big is "pretty big"? are you certain this is an optimisation you really need?
2019-10-25 15:53:32	snappy	mlk: Ok, so encoding/json provides a Decoder type and function NewDecoder which will take in an io.Reader; an io.Reader is an interface tha ttakes in any type that implements a Read(...) method
2019-10-25 15:54:25	mlk	siXy in this case I'm doing it for fun and practice, so the answer to that is somewhat irrelevant... if this were a product or something that's meant for production you'd be absolutely right to ask, and the answer would probably be no :)

2019-10-25 15:56:00	siXy	mlk: Okay, but that doesn't really change the fact that this is a problem that's much less reasonable to try to solve than it may appear. Decoding a stream of individual json responses is a very valid thing to do, and the docs for encoding/json provide an example for this.

2019-10-25 15:58:44	Wessie	doesn't sound like something encoding/json will do, if it's all one big JSON object and you only want some key at the start
2019-10-25 15:59:24	siXy	Trying to start decoding an individual json object before you've fully recieved it is less reasonable - until you've got the whole thing you can't know what the structure is going to be, so how do you know if it fits into {name, age} or {name, age, size} ?

2019-10-25 16:00:34	siXy	It's still possible, but only with significant increased complexity which isn't really worth it for a toy project IMO.
2019-10-25 16:00:48	mlk	I wouldn't necessarily need to decode it as json, it could be as simple as matching regexp on the response. For instance I know at the start of the response there'll be something like "next_id": "12345-abcde" and that's all I need

2019-10-25 16:01:15	mlk	the idea is to make the next request as early as I can, even before the rest of the body has been received and decoded as json
2019-10-25 16:02:50	Wessie	haven't needed this myself, but maybe https://github.com/json-iterator/go ?
2019-10-25 16:03:03	snappy	mlk: yeah that's doable as well, can you guarantee that the opening of the json starts on the same line as next_id, or even on a previous line?
2019-10-25 16:03:08	Wessie	not sure what the best package is for this, the benchmarks in that show other options too

2019-10-25 16:03:27	snappy	mlk: if those assumptions are true, you could scan with regex for a json object and start your decode from there.
2019-10-25 16:04:03	mlk	this id is supposed to be on the first line along with the opening of the json object, it has been the very first key every time I checked
2019-10-25 16:04:03	siXy	You could do the regexp test, fire off your other request, then do a normal stdlib decode of the full buffer once you have it.
2019-10-25 16:04:22	siXy	But I still think this smells of premature optimisation.
2019-10-25 16:04:25	mlk	yes that sounds perfect siXy - how would I accomplish that?
2019-10-25 16:04:57	siXy	well, start reading into a bytes.Buffer, once you hit enough data start a goroutine to use a regexp to examine it, while you continue to fill the buffer.
2019-10-25 16:04:59	mlk	I found the docs for the NewDecoder example so that part I understand now
2019-10-25 16:05:07	mlk	alright
2019-10-25 16:05:08	siXy	Then once you have the whole thing do a straight decode

2019-10-25 16:24:20	webstrand	I'm trying to fix a broken ebuild (spec-file) that previously built this package, before the dependencies were renamed
2019-10-25 16:24:26	siXy	You don't need to do this manually. You should never be downloading and unpacking tarballs. go get does require at least one argument however.
2019-10-25 16:25:19	siXy	At a minimum - cd into the directory of the thing you want to build, go get ./...; done. If that doesn't resolve your issue, read the docs here: https://golang.org/cmd/go/

2019-10-28 16:46:46	fub	so I'm using a few goroutines to write something to a database with gorm. I'm currently using sqlite for development. When the workers write concurrent, I often get a "database is locked" error when trying to add stuff.
2019-10-28 16:47:01	fub	Is this only because of sqlite or should I manually add a lock here?

2019-10-28 17:01:15	iivvoo	if you want to test the type of error, is defining custom errors (structs) the only option? Currently we're using fmt.Errorf() but you can't test against that reliably correct? Only print it
2019-10-28 17:02:35	siXy	iivvoo: io.EOF is just errors.New("EOF"), and that works reliably enough.
2019-10-28 17:02:48	siXy	You absolutely can create a custom error struct but you don't have to.

2019-10-29 16:38:30	Tv`	sztanpet: yeah i'm aware of the crypto api direction, and consider it somewhat unfortunate; i have many apps that load a key once up front and then use it often, and doing the error-checking bit just once was nice. i guess a reasonable tradeoff is func NewPrivateKey([]byte) (*PrivateKey, error) and then operations using that don't have errors
2019-10-29 16:39:24	Tv`	sztanpet: note: strong type, not one of those interfaces that are still open to misuse and need errors like taking crypto.PrivateKey as arg and then type asserting to an RSA key

2019-10-30 11:54:53	lionrouge	I need to merge k sorted lists but in terms of files
2019-10-30 11:55:04	lionrouge	I'l going to use a priority queue based on heap module
2019-10-30 11:55:11	-->	Joshun (~joshua@213.143.11.104) has joined #go-nuts
2019-10-30 11:55:13	lionrouge	how can I limit heap's size?
2019-10-30 11:56:04	lionrouge	I don't want it to grow indefinitely, potentionally eating all RAM
2019-10-30 11:57:32	lionrouge	what I'm thinking about is checking for heap size in Push function
2019-10-30 11:57:41	lionrouge	and wait if it's too large
2019-10-30 11:57:45	lionrouge	but how to wait?
2019-10-30 11:57:57	velco	wait for what ?
2019-10-30 11:58:13	lionrouge	maybe I should wait for any Pop operation and then check size again
2019-10-30 11:58:43	lionrouge	in C I would use pthread_cond_signal and pthread_cond_wait
2019-10-30 11:59:34	velco	maybe I don't get it what are you doing, but your heap size is at most k
2019-10-30 11:59:49	lionrouge	what is k?
2019-10-30 12:00:06	velco	"need to merge k sorted lists"
2019-10-30 12:00:56	lionrouge	I have a bunch of files which represent a contiguous stream of data and the order is unknown
2019-10-30 12:01:06	lionrouge	but they consists of frames and they have numbers
2019-10-30 12:01:21	lionrouge	basically I need to "defragment" it
2019-10-30 12:01:57	lionrouge	this stream of data was received from network, balanced over several processesm each writing to it's own file
2019-10-30 12:03:10	lionrouge	I would like to create a bunch of io.Reader for each such file, create go routing for each which will walk through all these "frames" and feed them to the heap (sort order will be determined by frame number)
2019-10-30 12:03:20	lionrouge	*go routine
2019-10-30 12:04:08	lionrouge	and main function will continuously read from heap (Pop actually), thus receiving those frames in order and then writing them to one file or sending somewhere
2019-10-30 12:05:41	lionrouge	but if go routines feeding the heap don't wait for the main loop, the heap will grow without bounds
2019-10-30 12:06:32	lionrouge	in case of overflow I would like them to wait until heap size is within limits again
2019-10-30 12:07:00	lionrouge	maybe just add some delay? Sounds dirty, I know

2019-10-30 12:46:21	lionrouge	1) basic heap implementation is not thread-safe
2019-10-30 12:46:42	lionrouge	2) I will write all transaction metadata to ONE channel
2019-10-30 12:47:05	lionrouge	3) I will read from it once then write to file once - it will prevent heap from growing
2019-10-30 12:47:24	lionrouge	and I will write using a buffer so that's efficient

2019-10-30 13:30:42	ezdiy	interface for a slice of your type, with compare/swap operators provided. then you can do a heap sort over it in generic way.
2019-10-30 13:30:58	ezdiy	look at sort package, you do pretty much the same, except instead of quick sort you do your insert sort thing

2019-10-30 13:33:55	BeerLove_	something like that?
2019-10-30 13:33:59	ezdiy	just interface { Less, Swap, Len }

2019-10-30 13:34:37	ezdiy	it sees only single interface pointer, and tells indices to Less and Swap

2019-10-30 13:57:47	BeerLove_	ezdiy I am doing leetcode and want to implement stuff
2019-10-30 13:57:56	ezdiy	:)
2019-10-30 13:57:57	BeerLove_	in go and not use libraries
2019-10-30 13:58:29	ezdiy	well, if the heap needs some custom features, you cant really use the library anyway

2019-10-30 13:58:59	ezdiy	but its nice if you conform to their interface regardless, so that the interfaced "generic" can be used interchangeably still for both your impl and std lib one
2019-10-30 13:59:04	BeerLove_	Next is I want to limit heap size so only "k" elements are there in the heap at all times

2019-10-30 14:25:10	rkeene	I'm running into an issue with Go (1.12 and 1.13, atleast) where the GC is using the majority of CPU time for one of my users -- disabling the GC results in acceptable performance but they run out of memory pretty quickly.  runtime.gcBgMarkWorker  with 8 goroutines used 33% of total program execution time.  Something is definitely amiss, but I haven't been able to pin it down.  This only happens for one

2019-11-04 11:59:45	Wessie	and it only works because their API takes a stupid interface{}

2019-11-04 12:00:23	Wessie	you want a []byte?

2019-11-04 12:00:32	b0nn	I *have* []byte
2019-11-04 12:00:42	Wessie	so change it to a string first

Due the the nature of templates on Go that are parsed and executed before rendering, how is this usually achieved? Quick way is to render dynamic DOM from JS with data returned from query to a handlerfunc, but this will bypass using the template engne for secutiry and sanitation.. How?

2019-11-04 15:25:03	GinjaNinja32	setting the package name to tetra will make `import "github.com/nch/tetraedron"` import it as `tetra`, which might not be what you want

2019-11-04 17:43:33	icholy	siXy: when you have to programatically build those up
2019-11-04 17:43:50	Zigara	when you use code gen you get type safety before it even hits the SQL server

2019-11-04 17:44:20	sztanpet	those are problems already solved by non-orms
2019-11-04 17:44:36	GinjaNinja32	it's useful in some cases (programmatic query generation, x IN <slice>) but doesn't really change much else except making you learn another syntax to specify what you want IMO
2019-11-04 17:44:50	GinjaNinja32	sqlx can handle the `x IN <slice>` I believe, too
2019-11-04 17:45:36	siXy	icholy: I've heard that one a lot, but I'm not overly convinced. A lot of the time a slight restructure can remove the need to do that at all, and if not - well we have templating.
2019-11-04 17:46:20	icholy	siXy: I've used text/template to generate SQL too. I don't have a strong preference either way.
2019-11-04 17:46:23	sztanpet	only reason to have a full blown orm is if the programmer knows no sql and there is a hard requirement on database agility

2019-11-04 17:48:31	siXy	Knowing no sql is not a good enough reason, IMO. SQL isn't that hard, and it's an important skill. Database agility is a bit more convincing, but very, very few non-trivial applications can really support database agility effectively even if there's an ORM generating valid query sytax.

2019-11-04 17:52:15	siXy	The core postgres devs fought tooth and nail to not support this for decades, beliving that one database per machine was the One True Way, and that backup/restore was good enough for everyone. Sadly this historical shortsightedness continues to create problems even today, even though they now have relaxed their attitude slightly.

2019-11-05 10:38:29	iivvoo	yeah but Type itself has to be explicit. You can't say x := User; y := new(x) (correct me if I'm wrong)

2019-11-05 11:03:44	shadowchaser	but i get his point, java is probably "safer", that's the reason i'm using c# on production rather than go, it just guides you by the hand:)
2019-11-05 11:04:21	nanoz	i liked golang for simplicity and readability.
2019-11-05 11:04:22	guido_g	still, given this kind of behaviour I vote for trolling
2019-11-05 11:04:47	nanoz	yes shadowchaser
2019-11-05 11:04:48	Stummi	nanoz, have you taken a look into kotlin?
2019-11-05 11:05:01	nanoz	nope Stummi
2019-11-05 11:05:33	Stummi	its a modern language for the JVM. If you liked golang for the modern syntax but java for the safeness and maturity of the JVM, kotlin may something for you
2019-11-05 11:06:40	iivvoo	all languages suck in some way. In my humble opinion java sucks more than golang. I do not feel the need, though, to go to #java and share that opinion
2019-11-05 11:06:53	nanoz	golang didnt have generics when i use work but they had goroutines features it was great.

2019-11-05 11:08:48	iivvoo	not sure if you're referring to me? I'm not trolling am I? Just stating my opinion that it's weird to complain about a language you're no longer using because you don't like it for the purpose of complaining

And in the example when they do s=s[2:4] the capacity becomes 3, how? shouldn't it be 2 as well?

2019-11-06 14:07:13	tuskkk____	look at the picture
2019-11-06 14:07:26	tuskkk____	The line - The length is the number of elements referred to by the slice. The capacity is the number of elements in the underlying array (beginning at the element referred to by the slice pointer)

2019-11-06 14:08:51	siXy	tuskkk____: You're still pointing at the original array, though, so the capacity reflects the end of the underlying original array.

2019-11-06 14:09:37	sztanpet	if in doubt, just test it
2019-11-06 14:09:55	siXy	tuskkk____: This might be less confusing if you use different numbers - do it again but with s := make([]byte, 10); s = s[2:4]; println(cap(s))
2019-11-06 14:10:25	siXy	The example would be clearer if the original array was larger so you don't get into n+1 confusion IMO.,
2019-11-06 14:10:41	sztanpet	yea
2019-11-06 14:11:19	tuskkk____	ah, so the capacity is till the end of the array
2019-11-06 14:11:33	sztanpet	only if not overriden as described
2019-11-06 14:12:08	tuskkk____	umm, how do you mean by "if not overriden"?
2019-11-06 14:12:15	sztanpet	hurr
2019-11-06 14:12:22	sztanpet	[11.06|13:58:45] <sztanpet> tuskkk____ the capacity is the argument you give make, or the third indice you give when re-slicing
2019-11-06 14:12:27	tuskkk____	ah
2019-11-06 14:12:29	tuskkk____	ok
2019-11-06 14:12:44	tuskkk____	thanks for clearing it up for me!
2019-11-06 14:13:18	siXy	I mean... the capacity is always until the end of the array in this case, but the end of the array can be longer than the _length_ of the original slice, if you provided a capacity arg to the oroginal make
2019-11-06 14:13:28	siXy	original*. I can't type :/
