2019-09-13 14:35:37	Stealthy	thats why i didnt want to go into irrelevant details :p
2019-09-13 14:35:40	A_D	Start by not using bigint.
2019-09-13 14:35:54	A_D	Then parallelise.
2019-09-13 14:36:07	A_D	But again
2019-09-13 14:36:08	lluad	Stealthy there are faster approaches. None of them are usefully faster. Assume yuor CPU is slower than 10Ghz, so can't do more than 10^10 operations a second. Do the arithmetic to see how long it'll take to do 2^256 operations.
2019-09-13 14:36:08	siXy	A_D: You're overstating the case a bit. A good implementation on a recent GPU can do over 5000 million sha256 hashes per second, which is plenty to make bruteforcing a reasonable search space affordable.
2019-09-13 14:36:30	A_D	siXy: I'm assuming they want to brute all of it
2019-09-13 14:36:35	A_D	given their proposed code
2019-09-13 14:36:41	siXy	Stealthy: Again, you are not going to be able to do this. You can't crack hashes on CPUs usefully.
2019-09-13 14:36:52	Stealthy	if you want to go the cuda route then good luck there is no quick sha256 library you can abuse
2019-09-13 14:36:57	siXy	Stealthy: Download and use oclhashcat. Solved.

2019-09-13 14:51:26	Stealthy	is there are a proper way to time elapsed without being too much of an impact performance wise
2019-09-13 14:51:36	A_D	Yes. use time.time.
2019-09-13 14:51:39	A_D	printing is SLOW
2019-09-13 14:51:45	A_D	horridly slow
2019-09-13 14:51:53	Stealthy	ya
2019-09-13 14:52:07	Stealthy	only reason a print was in there was to see/show
2019-09-13 14:52:11	Stealthy	it'll be gone from the logic
2019-09-13 14:52:43	Stealthy	thanks siXy will use profiling for sure
2019-09-13 14:53:15	Stealthy	coffee almost finished then i'll come up with a 4x int64 approach
2019-09-13 14:53:36	A_D	for printing, look at the select in line 127 here: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/Rbdkx5YqM5/
2019-09-13 14:53:51	siXy	(side note: my figures were apparently out of date and current GPUs will do about 7.5 billion hashes per second, per GPU.
2019-09-13 14:54:02	A_D	7.5? fuck thats quick

2019-09-13 15:00:24	lluad	SHA256 is a 256 bit / 32 byte hash. Given Stealthy's code had 64 hex digits, I'm assuming that's it.

2019-09-13 15:02:11	Stealthy	hehe
2019-09-13 15:02:14	A_D	sure, just mine all the silicon in this solar system
2019-09-13 15:02:15	Stealthy	only if you know the 2nd item
2019-09-13 15:02:18	A_D	and the one next door
2019-09-13 15:02:24	Stealthy	but what if you only had a 5th millionth key
2019-09-13 15:02:25	Stealthy	;)
2019-09-13 15:02:35	A_D	no, thats to brute force every hash in 256
2019-09-13 15:02:36	siXy	Powering them would be an exciting engineering challenge, too.
2019-09-13 15:02:40	Stealthy	you would need to recreate a hash chain from an assumed master key
2019-09-13 15:02:48	A_D	oh well you destroyed the solar systems anyway siXy
2019-09-13 15:02:55	A_D	may as well dyson sphere the stars
2019-09-13 15:03:01	siXy	I'll have to move nextdoor at this rate
2019-09-13 15:03:10	Stealthy	so for every iteration of an assumed master key you'd need to generate a hash chain to see if it comes up with one of the known hashes
2019-09-13 15:03:35	Stealthy	that's 5 million of hashes for every iteration of a starting hash
2019-09-13 15:03:44	lluad	(2^256 ~= 10^75. There are ~ 10^8 seconds in a year. So at 10GHz it'd take ~ 10^65 seconds, or ~ 10^58 years to walk the entire space.
2019-09-13 15:03:48	Stealthy	i never had the illusion that i'll get the actual match
2019-09-13 15:04:28	Stealthy	thats a guestimate
2019-09-13 15:04:49	A_D	a very good one

2019-09-13 15:05:22	A_D	I'd cut that in half to get what it'll probably take
2019-09-13 15:05:23	Stealthy	if you want to go more specific i can tell you the fastest intel docs can produce a 512 bit hash in 10 cycles
2019-09-13 15:05:28	A_D	give or take a thousand years

2019-09-13 17:22:16	A_D	the lang reference may be a bit faster for you to lookup then?
2019-09-13 17:22:31	A_D	https://golang.org/ref/spec its pretty small and has a nice index at the top
2019-09-13 17:23:01	A_D	also if you're coming from C, one thing that you may like/hate if you did not know: pointer resolution is usually done automatically for you

2019-09-13 17:25:46	Tv`	vulpix1337: in Go, C's "." and "->" operators are both spelled "."
2019-09-13 17:25:47	Stealthy	also in my case the bigint string can be slow; its the subroutine that has to be fast
2019-09-13 17:26:13	A_D	Tv`: thanks >.>
2019-09-13 17:26:15	Stealthy	a subroutine makes 10 million hashes based upon the one hash passed from the slow loop
2019-09-13 17:27:12	vulpix1337	Tv`: ahhh interesting
2019-09-13 17:27:50	Stealthy	with my cpu i can at max run 8 threads of these subroutines and thats where optimization can make an impact, not in main or on the slow string
2019-09-13 17:28:50	Stealthy	and these subroutines work with a byte (copy) of that slow string; its taken as the input for sha256 and outputs directly to the same byte array for the next iteration
2019-09-13 17:29:07	Stealthy	i dont see how a pool (or anything at this point) can make it quicker
2019-09-13 17:29:26	Stealthy	i even took the recreation of sha256 out and just write the buffer, calc sum

2019-09-13 17:30:47	A_D	Next step would be reading up on arrays vs slices and how slice growth works, I think

2019-09-13 17:31:48	Stealthy	i've been introduced with slices in JS but im not sure how it'll make my case quicker

2019-10-17 14:57:26	amitizle	Hey all, more of a style question: are you waiting for external services (external to your go app) to be ready on boot/periodically? Like Redis, DB etc. If so, how are you implementing it?

2019-10-17 15:00:31	ezdiy	ie if its a web app, it "hangs" until db connects, or just straight spits error message if the connection failures propagate
2019-10-17 15:01:39	amitizle	Cool, thanks, and how are you managing the queued requests? I mean do you have any specific cutoff where you just drop the requests?

2019-10-17 15:03:05	ezdiy	yes, usually there's a cutoff when the queue overflows, or the backoff goes up to some threshold

2019-10-17 17:36:00	lupine	yeah, that's the thing. one of my tests is using a HTTP socket, the other a fake reader that is uninterruptible. one test is good, the other bad.

2019-10-17 17:43:11	Tv`	the original question was about reading Request.Body though

2019-10-17 17:45:23	Tv`	and relying on body ending with error shortly after the handler panics is also not documented, but at least it sounds reasonable
2019-10-17 17:46:58	Tv`	cue brad's blue sky ng rewrite...

2019-10-18 13:13:13	godefrey	so my question is whether it's idiomatic (or not idiomatic) to form such groups and what appearance they should have

2019-10-18 13:13:47	godefrey	if you have any references that can answer that (sztanpet?)

2019-10-18 13:14:25	sztanpet	godefrey dunno, both sublime and vscode do the groupings and ordering for me, so i dont have to care

2019-10-21 15:47:46	nil	hi! go allows the user to omit semicolons and use newlines instead in some places, and this seems to be done by "automatically inserting" a semicolon at the end of the line during lexical analysis, given some condition on the last token parsed (see https://golang.org/ref/spec#Semicolons)

2019-10-21 15:57:48	lpapp|win	I would rather develop in go cygwin agnostic
2019-10-21 15:58:04	Wessie	so /cygdrive/c/Projects/Go
2019-10-21 15:58:31	lpapp|win	I hope the two git installations will not clash
2019-10-21 15:58:42	lpapp|win	not sure why cygwin cannot get it from a more systematic path though
2019-10-21 15:58:46	lpapp|win	why it has to be inside

2019-10-21 15:59:41	Wessie	been a while since I used cygwin, but I believe programs are compiled without knowledge that they're on windows, so a windows path just looks like a filename to them
2019-10-21 16:00:05	lpapp|win	old school docker :P
2019-10-21 16:00:53	icholy	in that they both suck?
2019-10-21 16:01:00	lpapp|win	lol
2019-10-21 16:01:13	lpapp|win	I do not know why anyone would use cygwin these days
2019-10-21 16:01:20	lpapp|win	but then the same goes to cvs they use
2019-10-21 16:01:41	lpapp|win	anyway, the system-wide git installation is the second in the output of where git
2019-10-21 16:01:43	icholy	WSL has replaced most uses for cygwin AFAIK
2019-10-21 16:01:52	lpapp|win	and which git still says: /usr/bin/git
2019-10-21 16:02:09	Wessie	that or msys yeah, works a lot smoother

2019-10-21 16:03:08	lpapp|win	so, what setup should I do to make it work for both of us
2019-10-21 16:03:31	Wessie	as suggested earlier, just swapping the GOPATH might just work
2019-10-21 16:03:50	lpapp|win	yeah, but that does not work if cygwin gets removed ...
2019-10-21 16:04:16	Wessie	they would have a missing git at that point
2019-10-21 16:04:25	icholy	lpapp|win: change the windows PATH to have the system wide git first
2019-10-21 16:04:29	lpapp|win	well, they would have the system-wide
2019-10-21 16:04:42	lpapp|win	can the system-wide git installation be prioritised outside cygwin, but not inside?
2019-10-21 16:04:55	lpapp|win	icholy, would that break inside cygwin?

2019-10-22 17:05:16	siXy	smw: The fmt.Fprint(h, ...) should do that.
2019-10-22 17:05:30	guido_g	see fmt.Fprint, the hash is written to

2019-10-22 17:06:58	guido_g	and that raises the question if not one of the faster hashes is better suited
2019-10-22 17:07:25	+smw	siXy, woops...

2019-10-22 17:08:14	+smw	icholy, "Hash is used to identify existing stores with the same options", that means security. Use sha256 or something :-)
2019-10-22 17:08:52	+smw	icholy, I take that back. if you plan to do a complete equality test after, then it isn't for security
2019-10-22 17:09:31	icholy	smw: yeah, the hash is used for the directory name and then there's a file inside will the full fidelity info (as json)
2019-10-22 17:09:31	siXy	icholy: In that case I'd do what you're doing now but either use a non-cryptographic hash like fingerprint2011 or a modern crypto hash like sha256.  using sha1 in new code today raises eyebrows and there's no good reason for it.
2019-10-22 17:09:32	icholy	with*
2019-10-22 17:10:29	siXy	unless you're doing this over hundreds of thousands of things, I'd opt for the latter and go with sha256 - it's safer and you don't need to think about side effects
2019-10-22 17:10:43	albertito	icholy: you need to be careful when doing things like that because, in addition to the choice of hashing, how you serialize the data matters

2019-10-22 17:25:18	Tv`	my rule of thumb is, never pretend to hash anything that isn't []byte -- so if this is about deduplicating things stored in something, first marshal it, then dedup on the []byte (with a hash of the byte sequence)
2019-10-22 17:25:52	Tv`	also, if this is inmemory, a go map can use Options as the key type just fine

2019-10-24 12:04:20	BeerLover	I wanted to know how I can implement data structures in Go with generic types. I have been solving Leetcode problems and from time to time I have to implement data structures for various types int, floats etc. Is there a way? For example, https://play.golang.org/p/GBy0inCJO3U
2019-10-24 12:04:36	BeerLover	here I implemented Heap - min and max for Ints

2019-10-24 12:06:46	BeerLover	How would I go about using interfaces for this example?
2019-10-24 12:07:24	BeerLover	I have been feeling that Go doesn't facilitate code reuse that much.
2019-10-24 12:07:54	bookworm	no it doesn't
2019-10-24 12:08:35	velco	not *that* form of code reuse
2019-10-24 12:08:46	bookworm	for the built-in types you can't use interfaces (at least the basic ones like int or bool)
2019-10-24 12:09:02	velco	bookworm, what do you mean ?
2019-10-24 12:09:19	bookworm	>> How would I go about using interfaces for this example?
2019-10-24 12:09:31	bookworm	example being min / max
2019-10-24 12:10:03	bookworm	which you can't do say for int / uint / int32 etc
2019-10-24 12:10:19	bookworm	as you can't put methods on those types
2019-10-24 12:11:18	velco	" you can't put methods on those types" is very different from "for the built-in types you can't use interfaces (at least the basic ones like int or bool)"

Interfaces solve a different problem to generics - if you have a walk through tour.golang.org that will get you started with how they work and what they're for.

2019-10-24 17:09:04	seebs	"minimal" is almost certainly "just stdlib", since presumably the existence of the packages shows that it's possible to do the thing using stdlib. :P
2019-10-24 17:11:42	seebs	(with a handful of exceptions, like stuff using OpenGL)
2019-10-24 17:13:47	siXy	afidegnum: One reason you may feel like you get less help here than you may prefer is the insistence on using frameworks like chi - they're extremely unpopular here, for good reasons - they obscure what's really happening and are usually not needed. If you were to re-write this without all the chi stuff, without cors, etc you'd probably not only find your life easier, but you'd get more support too.
2019-10-24 17:14:54	siXy	If your code is just bolting together various 3rd party frameworks of variable quality to help you we need to spend a bunch of effort figuring out what those frameworks do, unless you're lucky enough to find someone that's used that specific combination and has time/inclination to help. The odds of this are not high, especially here.

2019-10-24 17:49:06	Zunino	I'm having trouble understanding how to create and use modules properly. This is a basic project structure I created: https://pastebin.com/krBtKnj4
2019-10-24 17:49:16	Tv`	somebody didn't get the memo about what testing is meant to do... https://github.com/mdp/qrterminal/blob/master/qrterminal_test.go
2019-10-24 17:49:31	Zunino	Basically, I wrote a small "lib" and would like to use it from main.go, a test program.
2019-10-24 17:49:52	Zunino	But, as you can see, go run complains about being unable to find the module.
2019-10-24 17:49:52	Tv`	Zunino: you most likely want just one top-level go.mod
2019-10-24 17:50:26	Zunino	Tv`: Tried it before. But IIRC, there was an error about having more than a package in the same dir.
2019-10-24 17:50:33	Tv`	that's unrelated...

2019-10-25 11:51:37	Shrike	having a select isn't forced, you just need to keep checking up whether the context is done during the function

2019-10-25 11:52:00	Shrike	but if it's a loop of a bunch of smaller operations, then it's really easy

2019-10-25 11:52:26	nindustries	wonder how sql does it
2019-10-25 11:52:43	Shrike	you can't cancel in the middle of a large operation
2019-10-25 11:52:54	Shrike	the operation might return, but it's still running on the DB server

2019-10-25 12:59:13	afidegnum	hello, i m reading about pointers again, i have some pertinent question, why do we append * to have the value of the address of a variable when a normal variable assignment could also work? here is an example
2019-10-25 12:59:26	afidegnum	https://play.golang.com/p/NGJoniCosbA
2019-10-25 12:59:44	Tichodroma	define "work"
2019-10-25 13:00:12	Tichodroma	also "car c int = &b" is not valid
2019-10-25 13:00:13	afidegnum	i mean using a normal variable is also able to print the address of the related variable
2019-10-25 13:00:35	afidegnum	sorry, it's a typo
2019-10-25 13:01:09	Tichodroma	can you fix so it runs?
2019-10-25 13:01:22	afidegnum	ah, why the compiler didn't give an earlier error
2019-10-25 13:01:28	afidegnum	do we have car in golang ?
2019-10-25 13:01:38	Tichodroma	?
2019-10-25 13:01:43	Zigara	even if you fix car -> var it still won't work
2019-10-25 13:01:53	Tichodroma	^ +1
2019-10-25 13:02:00	velco	afidegnum, no matter what you have pointER value and pointED value; you need to tell which one to use
2019-10-25 13:02:17	siXy	afidegnum: Do you know what pointers actually are?
2019-10-25 13:02:26	afidegnum	ok, i got it, & is a type *int
2019-10-25 13:03:22	siXy	afidegnum: I think you should do some more reading, perhaps using this as a starting point: https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/8
2019-10-25 13:03:28	afidegnum	Zigara: yes, it didn't
2019-10-25 13:03:33	siXy	There are some fundamental concepts you appear to be missing
2019-10-25 13:03:54	afidegnum	siXy: i have been reading a lots about pointers, i m revising the concepts again,

2019-10-25 15:50:54	mlk	Hi folks, I want to make a request to a url that'll respond with a pretty big json doc. I want to start reading it ASAP, even before it's complete, so that I can call a go routine with something I expect to be at the start of said json doc. Is there a way of doing so?
2019-10-25 15:50:55	snappy	i feel like i've asked this before - but i keep doing the same thing over and over again; when using GOPATH can you use git worktrees? A git worktree is basically a directory dedicated to a git branch in your tree; it allows you to swap branches by simply changing directory into the appropriate worktree.
2019-10-25 15:51:15	snappy	It seems vendor doesn't play well with it.
2019-10-25 15:52:03	snappy	mlk: can you wrap this in an io.Reader style interface?
2019-10-25 15:52:28	mlk	I'm very new at go, that question went over my head
2019-10-25 15:53:29	siXy	mlk: How big is "pretty big"? are you certain this is an optimisation you really need?
2019-10-25 15:53:32	snappy	mlk: Ok, so encoding/json provides a Decoder type and function NewDecoder which will take in an io.Reader; an io.Reader is an interface tha ttakes in any type that implements a Read(...) method
2019-10-25 15:54:25	mlk	siXy in this case I'm doing it for fun and practice, so the answer to that is somewhat irrelevant... if this were a product or something that's meant for production you'd be absolutely right to ask, and the answer would probably be no :)

2019-10-25 15:56:00	siXy	mlk: Okay, but that doesn't really change the fact that this is a problem that's much less reasonable to try to solve than it may appear. Decoding a stream of individual json responses is a very valid thing to do, and the docs for encoding/json provide an example for this.

2019-10-25 15:58:44	Wessie	doesn't sound like something encoding/json will do, if it's all one big JSON object and you only want some key at the start
2019-10-25 15:59:24	siXy	Trying to start decoding an individual json object before you've fully recieved it is less reasonable - until you've got the whole thing you can't know what the structure is going to be, so how do you know if it fits into {name, age} or {name, age, size} ?

2019-10-25 16:00:34	siXy	It's still possible, but only with significant increased complexity which isn't really worth it for a toy project IMO.
2019-10-25 16:00:48	mlk	I wouldn't necessarily need to decode it as json, it could be as simple as matching regexp on the response. For instance I know at the start of the response there'll be something like "next_id": "12345-abcde" and that's all I need

2019-10-25 16:01:15	mlk	the idea is to make the next request as early as I can, even before the rest of the body has been received and decoded as json
2019-10-25 16:02:50	Wessie	haven't needed this myself, but maybe https://github.com/json-iterator/go ?
2019-10-25 16:03:03	snappy	mlk: yeah that's doable as well, can you guarantee that the opening of the json starts on the same line as next_id, or even on a previous line?
2019-10-25 16:03:08	Wessie	not sure what the best package is for this, the benchmarks in that show other options too

2019-10-25 16:03:27	snappy	mlk: if those assumptions are true, you could scan with regex for a json object and start your decode from there.
2019-10-25 16:04:03	mlk	this id is supposed to be on the first line along with the opening of the json object, it has been the very first key every time I checked
2019-10-25 16:04:03	siXy	You could do the regexp test, fire off your other request, then do a normal stdlib decode of the full buffer once you have it.
2019-10-25 16:04:22	siXy	But I still think this smells of premature optimisation.
2019-10-25 16:04:25	mlk	yes that sounds perfect siXy - how would I accomplish that?
2019-10-25 16:04:57	siXy	well, start reading into a bytes.Buffer, once you hit enough data start a goroutine to use a regexp to examine it, while you continue to fill the buffer.
2019-10-25 16:04:59	mlk	I found the docs for the NewDecoder example so that part I understand now
2019-10-25 16:05:07	mlk	alright
2019-10-25 16:05:08	siXy	Then once you have the whole thing do a straight decode

2019-10-25 16:24:20	webstrand	I'm trying to fix a broken ebuild (spec-file) that previously built this package, before the dependencies were renamed
2019-10-25 16:24:26	siXy	You don't need to do this manually. You should never be downloading and unpacking tarballs. go get does require at least one argument however.
2019-10-25 16:25:19	siXy	At a minimum - cd into the directory of the thing you want to build, go get ./...; done. If that doesn't resolve your issue, read the docs here: https://golang.org/cmd/go/

2019-10-28 16:46:46	fub	so I'm using a few goroutines to write something to a database with gorm. I'm currently using sqlite for development. When the workers write concurrent, I often get a "database is locked" error when trying to add stuff.
2019-10-28 16:47:01	fub	Is this only because of sqlite or should I manually add a lock here?

2019-10-28 17:01:15	iivvoo	if you want to test the type of error, is defining custom errors (structs) the only option? Currently we're using fmt.Errorf() but you can't test against that reliably correct? Only print it
2019-10-28 17:02:35	siXy	iivvoo: io.EOF is just errors.New("EOF"), and that works reliably enough.
2019-10-28 17:02:48	siXy	You absolutely can create a custom error struct but you don't have to.

2019-10-29 16:38:30	Tv`	sztanpet: yeah i'm aware of the crypto api direction, and consider it somewhat unfortunate; i have many apps that load a key once up front and then use it often, and doing the error-checking bit just once was nice. i guess a reasonable tradeoff is func NewPrivateKey([]byte) (*PrivateKey, error) and then operations using that don't have errors
2019-10-29 16:39:24	Tv`	sztanpet: note: strong type, not one of those interfaces that are still open to misuse and need errors like taking crypto.PrivateKey as arg and then type asserting to an RSA key

2019-10-30 11:54:53	lionrouge	I need to merge k sorted lists but in terms of files
2019-10-30 11:55:04	lionrouge	I'l going to use a priority queue based on heap module
2019-10-30 11:55:11	-->	Joshun (~joshua@213.143.11.104) has joined #go-nuts
2019-10-30 11:55:13	lionrouge	how can I limit heap's size?
2019-10-30 11:56:04	lionrouge	I don't want it to grow indefinitely, potentionally eating all RAM
2019-10-30 11:57:32	lionrouge	what I'm thinking about is checking for heap size in Push function
2019-10-30 11:57:41	lionrouge	and wait if it's too large
2019-10-30 11:57:45	lionrouge	but how to wait?
2019-10-30 11:57:57	velco	wait for what ?
2019-10-30 11:58:13	lionrouge	maybe I should wait for any Pop operation and then check size again
2019-10-30 11:58:43	lionrouge	in C I would use pthread_cond_signal and pthread_cond_wait
2019-10-30 11:59:34	velco	maybe I don't get it what are you doing, but your heap size is at most k
2019-10-30 11:59:49	lionrouge	what is k?
2019-10-30 12:00:06	velco	"need to merge k sorted lists"
2019-10-30 12:00:56	lionrouge	I have a bunch of files which represent a contiguous stream of data and the order is unknown
2019-10-30 12:01:06	lionrouge	but they consists of frames and they have numbers
2019-10-30 12:01:21	lionrouge	basically I need to "defragment" it
2019-10-30 12:01:57	lionrouge	this stream of data was received from network, balanced over several processesm each writing to it's own file
2019-10-30 12:03:10	lionrouge	I would like to create a bunch of io.Reader for each such file, create go routing for each which will walk through all these "frames" and feed them to the heap (sort order will be determined by frame number)
2019-10-30 12:03:20	lionrouge	*go routine
2019-10-30 12:04:08	lionrouge	and main function will continuously read from heap (Pop actually), thus receiving those frames in order and then writing them to one file or sending somewhere
2019-10-30 12:05:41	lionrouge	but if go routines feeding the heap don't wait for the main loop, the heap will grow without bounds
2019-10-30 12:06:32	lionrouge	in case of overflow I would like them to wait until heap size is within limits again
2019-10-30 12:07:00	lionrouge	maybe just add some delay? Sounds dirty, I know

2019-10-30 12:46:21	lionrouge	1) basic heap implementation is not thread-safe
2019-10-30 12:46:42	lionrouge	2) I will write all transaction metadata to ONE channel
2019-10-30 12:47:05	lionrouge	3) I will read from it once then write to file once - it will prevent heap from growing
2019-10-30 12:47:24	lionrouge	and I will write using a buffer so that's efficient

2019-10-30 13:30:42	ezdiy	interface for a slice of your type, with compare/swap operators provided. then you can do a heap sort over it in generic way.
2019-10-30 13:30:58	ezdiy	look at sort package, you do pretty much the same, except instead of quick sort you do your insert sort thing

2019-10-30 13:33:55	BeerLove_	something like that?
2019-10-30 13:33:59	ezdiy	just interface { Less, Swap, Len }

2019-10-30 13:34:37	ezdiy	it sees only single interface pointer, and tells indices to Less and Swap

2019-10-30 13:57:47	BeerLove_	ezdiy I am doing leetcode and want to implement stuff
2019-10-30 13:57:56	ezdiy	:)
2019-10-30 13:57:57	BeerLove_	in go and not use libraries
2019-10-30 13:58:29	ezdiy	well, if the heap needs some custom features, you cant really use the library anyway

2019-10-30 13:58:59	ezdiy	but its nice if you conform to their interface regardless, so that the interfaced "generic" can be used interchangeably still for both your impl and std lib one
2019-10-30 13:59:04	BeerLove_	Next is I want to limit heap size so only "k" elements are there in the heap at all times

2019-10-30 14:25:10	rkeene	I'm running into an issue with Go (1.12 and 1.13, atleast) where the GC is using the majority of CPU time for one of my users -- disabling the GC results in acceptable performance but they run out of memory pretty quickly.  runtime.gcBgMarkWorker  with 8 goroutines used 33% of total program execution time.  Something is definitely amiss, but I haven't been able to pin it down.  This only happens for one

2019-11-04 11:59:45	Wessie	and it only works because their API takes a stupid interface{}

2019-11-04 12:00:23	Wessie	you want a []byte?

2019-11-04 12:00:32	b0nn	I *have* []byte
2019-11-04 12:00:42	Wessie	so change it to a string first

Due the the nature of templates on Go that are parsed and executed before rendering, how is this usually achieved? Quick way is to render dynamic DOM from JS with data returned from query to a handlerfunc, but this will bypass using the template engne for secutiry and sanitation.. How?

2019-11-04 15:25:03	GinjaNinja32	setting the package name to tetra will make `import "github.com/nch/tetraedron"` import it as `tetra`, which might not be what you want

2019-11-04 17:43:33	icholy	siXy: when you have to programatically build those up
2019-11-04 17:43:50	Zigara	when you use code gen you get type safety before it even hits the SQL server

2019-11-04 17:44:20	sztanpet	those are problems already solved by non-orms
2019-11-04 17:44:36	GinjaNinja32	it's useful in some cases (programmatic query generation, x IN <slice>) but doesn't really change much else except making you learn another syntax to specify what you want IMO
2019-11-04 17:44:50	GinjaNinja32	sqlx can handle the `x IN <slice>` I believe, too
2019-11-04 17:45:36	siXy	icholy: I've heard that one a lot, but I'm not overly convinced. A lot of the time a slight restructure can remove the need to do that at all, and if not - well we have templating.
2019-11-04 17:46:20	icholy	siXy: I've used text/template to generate SQL too. I don't have a strong preference either way.
2019-11-04 17:46:23	sztanpet	only reason to have a full blown orm is if the programmer knows no sql and there is a hard requirement on database agility

2019-11-04 17:48:31	siXy	Knowing no sql is not a good enough reason, IMO. SQL isn't that hard, and it's an important skill. Database agility is a bit more convincing, but very, very few non-trivial applications can really support database agility effectively even if there's an ORM generating valid query sytax.

2019-11-04 17:52:15	siXy	The core postgres devs fought tooth and nail to not support this for decades, beliving that one database per machine was the One True Way, and that backup/restore was good enough for everyone. Sadly this historical shortsightedness continues to create problems even today, even though they now have relaxed their attitude slightly.

2019-11-05 10:38:29	iivvoo	yeah but Type itself has to be explicit. You can't say x := User; y := new(x) (correct me if I'm wrong)

2019-11-05 11:03:44	shadowchaser	but i get his point, java is probably "safer", that's the reason i'm using c# on production rather than go, it just guides you by the hand:)
2019-11-05 11:04:21	nanoz	i liked golang for simplicity and readability.
2019-11-05 11:04:22	guido_g	still, given this kind of behaviour I vote for trolling
2019-11-05 11:04:47	nanoz	yes shadowchaser
2019-11-05 11:04:48	Stummi	nanoz, have you taken a look into kotlin?
2019-11-05 11:05:01	nanoz	nope Stummi
2019-11-05 11:05:33	Stummi	its a modern language for the JVM. If you liked golang for the modern syntax but java for the safeness and maturity of the JVM, kotlin may something for you
2019-11-05 11:06:40	iivvoo	all languages suck in some way. In my humble opinion java sucks more than golang. I do not feel the need, though, to go to #java and share that opinion
2019-11-05 11:06:53	nanoz	golang didnt have generics when i use work but they had goroutines features it was great.

2019-11-05 11:08:48	iivvoo	not sure if you're referring to me? I'm not trolling am I? Just stating my opinion that it's weird to complain about a language you're no longer using because you don't like it for the purpose of complaining

And in the example when they do s=s[2:4] the capacity becomes 3, how? shouldn't it be 2 as well?

2019-11-06 14:07:13	tuskkk____	look at the picture
2019-11-06 14:07:26	tuskkk____	The line - The length is the number of elements referred to by the slice. The capacity is the number of elements in the underlying array (beginning at the element referred to by the slice pointer)

2019-11-06 14:08:51	siXy	tuskkk____: You're still pointing at the original array, though, so the capacity reflects the end of the underlying original array.

2019-11-06 14:09:37	sztanpet	if in doubt, just test it
2019-11-06 14:09:55	siXy	tuskkk____: This might be less confusing if you use different numbers - do it again but with s := make([]byte, 10); s = s[2:4]; println(cap(s))
2019-11-06 14:10:25	siXy	The example would be clearer if the original array was larger so you don't get into n+1 confusion IMO.,
2019-11-06 14:10:41	sztanpet	yea
2019-11-06 14:11:19	tuskkk____	ah, so the capacity is till the end of the array
2019-11-06 14:11:33	sztanpet	only if not overriden as described

2019-11-06 14:12:22	sztanpet	[11.06|13:58:45] <sztanpet> tuskkk____ the capacity is the argument you give make, or the third indice you give when re-slicing
2019-11-06 14:12:27	tuskkk____	ah
2019-11-06 14:12:29	tuskkk____	ok
2019-11-06 14:12:44	tuskkk____	thanks for clearing it up for me!
2019-11-06 14:13:18	siXy	I mean... the capacity is always until the end of the array in this case, but the end of the array can be longer than the _length_ of the original slice, if you provided a capacity arg to the oroginal make
2019-11-06 14:13:28	siXy	original*. I can't type :/

2019-11-06 17:28:13	sangy	hi, what's the "right" way to address this? go: modules disabled inside GOPATH/src by GO111MODULE=auto; see 'go help modules'
2019-11-06 17:28:39	sangy	I'm assuming I can either GO111MODULE=on or I can just use dep instead?
2019-11-06 17:28:39	guido_g	address what?
2019-11-06 17:28:43	siXy	sangy: Have you read go help modules ?
2019-11-06 17:29:06	sangy	siXy: I have. I'm trying to future-proof my decision
2019-11-06 17:29:30	sangy	I could also "unset" gopath in appveyor, but I imagine that *also* has consequences
2019-11-06 17:29:37	siXy	Okay, then you want go modules in preference to dep.

2019-11-06 17:33:58	sangy	edrocks: yeah, we're using 1.13+ everywhere but appveyor is being naughty :/
2019-11-06 17:34:49	edrocks	ehh modules were a little rough(mostly from having to migrate) the first time I used but I'm quite happy with them now. Hang in there
2019-11-06 17:34:54	sangy	honestly modules make things way easier to reason about when coming from other buildsystems
2019-11-06 17:35:26	sangy	so we're trying to migrate things around asap. Some CI's just make opinionated calls that are hard to debug

2019-11-07 11:36:42	mweckbecker	is my assumption accurate that https://pastebin.com/raw/4ygpK71t is just another limitation of golang (error message inside)? i.e. you cannot annotate nested structs that are declared inline.

2019-11-07 12:08:44	cmrabet	Hi all
2019-11-07 12:11:15	cmrabet	I made a helper function that accepts the http.ResponseWriter from a handler, an http code, and data (interface{}), which then Marshals the data into JSON, sets content-type header, and writes the http response. This is working as expected, the only problem is that when I curl the endpoint, curl shows the proper data but never concludes, it stays waiting. Any ideas why the connection is not closing?

2019-11-07 12:20:24	cmrabet	sztanpet, with curl, from the browser it closes.. it seems
2019-11-07 12:20:39	cmrabet	but curl doesn't
2019-11-07 12:21:43	cmrabet	Do I need to pass http.Request to the helper function ???
2019-11-07 12:21:45	sztanpet	a few notes about the code: feels like your queryvalidator is using panics to signal expected errors, you could be avoiding a lot of generated garbage by using the streaming json encoder
2019-11-07 12:22:23	sztanpet	well are you disabling keepalives when launching the http server?
2019-11-07 12:23:16	cmrabet	sztanpet, queryvalidaor doesn't panic, here is the code: https://pastebin.com/MLQjJ97A
2019-11-07 12:23:51	sztanpet	ah i see, cool
2019-11-07 12:24:13	cmrabet	it basically adds errors into the Validator.Errors, and then the method isValid counts them and returns tru or false
2019-11-07 12:24:26	cmrabet	Validator.Errors is another type I created
2019-11-07 12:24:30	sztanpet	also, curl -v will tell you what its waiting for
2019-11-07 12:25:02	sztanpet	since you arent sending a content-length header
2019-11-07 12:25:05	cmrabet	sztanpet, let me try that
2019-11-07 12:25:40	sztanpet	which you could be doing since you arent using the streaming encoder

2019-11-07 12:28:56	cmrabet	sztanpet, all the examples I've seen for snending JSON encoded data are only setting the content-type one, and using the WiterIO interface of http>ResponseWriter
2019-11-07 12:29:05	guido_g	nope content-length is not needed, see https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ResponseWriter

2019-11-07 17:45:52	tharkun	Good $DAY. I have been spoiled by DBIx::Class ORM in Perl. Is there a an ORM in Go that will have the dataset as a first class citizen. So far I have found serveral of these but they seem to favour code over data (in my perspective) My pain at the moment is having to set up a lot of tables of a production database to be accesed from go. Any suggestions or am I condemned to do the manual error prone typing?

2019-11-07 17:48:16	jarlopez	I've got a server endpoint that takes a JSON body, spins off a goroutine for doing the actual work (communicating with other services, processing their responses, and responding on an asycnhronous queue), and returns with a response representing "I registered your request with ID abc123, check the queue for the response"

2019-11-08 10:03:36	jadax	these subkeys (numbers) differ and I don't know how many of these are there
2019-11-08 10:03:42	jadax	so that's worst of the worst
2019-11-08 10:04:04	jadax	how would you unmarshal that?
2019-11-08 10:04:28	jadax	there's no static struct that I could define for it
2019-11-08 10:04:47	jadax	and the way it comes from an API, it's not an array either

2019-11-08 12:29:55	eZanmoto	According to https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#DeepEqual, "[in] general DeepEqual is a recursive relaxation of Go's == operator", and "[func] values are deeply equal if both are nil; otherwise they are not deeply equal." From this I would infer that functions can't be equated in this way, but I wouldn't know for sure.

2019-11-11 10:31:14	iivvoo	jadax do you currently have your sql table data in some Go struct?
2019-11-11 10:31:30	jadax	iivvoo nope, I'm fetching it directly from database
2019-11-11 10:32:00	jadax	and I want to parse it within go, maybe I don't need JSON for that? maybe I could just fetch it from database to go struct and go from there?

2019-11-11 10:32:49	jadax	so I need to have it packed nicely into some sort of object (JSON / go struct or whatever else)

2019-11-11 10:33:21	eZanmoto	jadax Absolutely, once you have the data in regular Go objects then you can process it as you need it. In general you'll only need to encode it using JSON if you then want to send it to some other process, or save it for later processing.

2019-11-11 10:36:45	eZanmoto	@jadax Yes, though it's more like 1 row = 1 instance of a Go struct.
2019-11-11 10:37:02	jadax	of course
2019-11-11 10:38:21	eZanmoto	@jadax If you're defining the database yourself then I'd recommend http://gorm.io/ for the database definition, and it'll make extracting the data for processing a bit easier.

2019-11-11 10:39:36	eZanmoto	@jadax Either way, your best bet at this point is to start from a tutorial/guide, try to get some code up and running, and post it on here if you run into issues.
2019-11-11 10:39:36	jadax	that's not MySQL though, is it?
2019-11-11 10:40:21	jadax	this go tool I'm doing right now is part of bigger story, I have few other microservices hooked off that database, it's gotta be MySQL or Postgres

2019-11-11 10:40:27	eZanmoto	@jadax It's an abstraction layer on top of MySQL and other databases. It just takes care of some of the common boilerplate.
2019-11-11 10:40:39	jadax	alright, I see now
2019-11-11 10:41:23	eZanmoto	@jadax If the database is already defined then I'd just go with plain MySQL; if it were a toy/hobby project that you were using to learn Go then I'd use GORM.
2019-11-11 10:44:01	jadax	eZanmoto I have few structs already with json fields, like this: https://hastebin.com/raw/cahepejewo

2019-11-11 10:44:40	jadax	could I add GORM tags to it? That way I could have 1 structure and use it for both, database and JSON
2019-11-11 10:44:53	jadax	I do already work with external JSONs, side note
2019-11-11 10:46:12	eZanmoto	@jadax I'd probably just use MySQL directly in your case; you could use GORM tags and it could make things easier in theory, but it's an extra layer of abstraction and you might find it more difficult to debug if things go wrong early on.
2019-11-11 10:46:31	jadax	ok
2019-11-11 10:48:07	eZanmoto	To be honest, I'd just forget about JSON until you need it - JSON is easy to convert to using Go so you really don't have to worry about it now. Get it working first and then you can make things simpler.
2019-11-11 10:48:49	jadax	I have bunch of external data that originates from external REST API, I'm pushing that data to database
2019-11-11 10:48:58	jadax	so I do have to convert JSON -> database
2019-11-11 10:49:15	jadax	I just thought using JSON internally could be beneficial
2019-11-11 10:49:24	jadax	but probably makes more sense to use native go structs internally

2019-11-11 10:54:53	eZanmoto	@jadax I think so. To be honest, once you've worked through this project then the application of JSON and structs should make themselves more apparent.

2019-11-12 11:19:10	iivvoo	purely parsing options? Just start with flag

2019-11-12 16:03:35	tgirod	hi. is there a way to do bidirectional RPC between a server and multiple clients with net/rpc?
2019-11-12 16:03:41	tuskkk____	sztanpet: this is what I am trying to do, https://play.golang.org/p/qYR-4FBj73Z
2019-11-12 16:05:06	sztanpet	tuskkk____ explained nothing to me, are you having concrete problems after reading the tour?
2019-11-12 16:05:24	tgirod	right now I'm using a simple tcp socket to pass messages between clients and server, but adding a bit of structure to the protocol would probably help in the future
2019-11-12 16:05:25	edrocks	tgirod haven't used net/rpc but worse case you'd setup a server on either side. Kind of hard to deploy that though depending on what you control
2019-11-12 16:05:43	edrocks	tgirod have you considered just a simple http server?
2019-11-12 16:06:05	tuskkk____	sztanpet: yeah, I don't have a type with me, all I have is some struct
2019-11-12 16:06:10	tgirod	edrocks: everything is running on the same machine. right now I use simple tcp sockets to pass messages around
2019-11-12 16:06:22	iivvoo	bidirectional rpc? Perhaps you want something like libp2p in stead?
2019-11-12 16:06:27	edrocks	oh then it doesn't really matter what you do
2019-11-12 16:06:41	sztanpet	tuskkk____ of course you do, its t2 silly
2019-11-12 16:07:06	tgirod	what I need is inter-process communication, actually
2019-11-12 16:07:21	tgirod	I framed that into RPC, but that's only one way to do it I guess
2019-11-12 16:07:34	edrocks	are these two go programs?
2019-11-12 16:08:01	tgirod	edrocks: yes
2019-11-12 16:08:17	iivvoo	tgirod, redis?
2019-11-12 16:08:20	tgirod	they can even share some code.

2019-11-12 16:08:41	edrocks	what are you doing that you need two processes?
2019-11-12 16:08:42	sztanpet	tuskkk____ are type assertions not clear, or you think your badly-named getHashMap should be retruning a concrete type?
2019-11-12 16:09:19	edrocks	you can use http servers on either side, rpc on either side, various types of sockets, etc
2019-11-12 16:09:27	tgirod	my server is running the state and logic of the game, and each client is managing some display
2019-11-12 16:10:02	tgirod	or can I pass commands as gob encoded structs through my socket, maybe?
2019-11-12 16:10:11	edrocks	that's an option too
2019-11-12 16:10:12	tuskkk____	sztanpet: badly named?
2019-11-12 16:10:32	sztanpet	tuskkk____ if its a redis wrapper, its fine, otherwise its not returning a hashmap
2019-11-12 16:10:33	tuskkk____	sztanpet: would it be possible to return a concrete type from there?
2019-11-12 16:10:39	edrocks	I strongly recommend you keep 2 layers for your logic and for your network/communication code
2019-11-12 16:10:53	sztanpet	tuskkk____ of course, define it as returning a concrete type
2019-11-12 16:10:58	edrocks	ie don't throw everything in whatever request/command handlers you setup
2019-11-12 16:11:14	tuskkk____	sztanpet: how?
2019-11-12 16:11:16	tgirod	edrocks: right.
2019-11-12 16:11:20	tgirod	thanks
2019-11-12 16:11:50	sztanpet	tuskkk____ https://tour.golang.org/basics/4 dont think you have a problem with this?
2019-11-12 16:12:00	edrocks	also what kind of game is this? Anything like an fps or mmo would probably require a custom protcol over sockets to be efficient
2019-11-12 16:12:21	sztanpet	tuskkk____ are you maybe thinking you want to return concrete types dynamically? because no, you cant do that
2019-11-12 16:12:22	tuskkk____	🤦
2019-11-12 16:13:01	livcd	I am having some really weird issues with VSCode and the Go extension from Microsoft

2019-11-12 16:13:17	tuskkk____	ok, to simplify, say I want to pass in a struct and receive it back, how do I generalise that?
2019-11-12 16:13:36	edrocks	tuskkk____ use an interface
2019-11-12 16:13:43	edrocks	or generate code. Go doesn't have generics

2019-11-12 16:14:11	edrocks	You can also use reflect in some situations but it's hard
2019-11-12 16:14:17	sztanpet	tuskkk____ just type assert the returned interface{} on the client side of your api

2019-11-12 17:12:31	lupine	It's just a state the scheduler knows about. If you dig deep enough, there's probably a condition variable

2019-11-12 17:30:26	Tjowers	So the end of the queue has null, when null is read the queue is empty, but it could also be a zero value so it's difficult to know how they do it, they must have some kind of header structure that the channel's address points to
2019-11-12 17:32:03	Tjowers	A dirty bit probably, if you `ch <- x` then you mark it as modified and the next go routine that reads it can continue, when you `x <- ch` you yield until it's modified
2019-11-12 17:32:40	Tjowers	It's like a cheaper lock, the difference being that no distinction between who "owns the lock" it's only has it been modified

2019-11-14 16:23:02	dupondje	anyway, seems like adjusting r.From is not working, and have to set query: r.URL.RawQuery = q.Encode()
2019-11-14 16:23:18	sztanpet	dont even know what r.From is
2019-11-14 16:23:35	sztanpet	anyway, you might want to show code
2019-11-14 16:23:58	dupondje	seems to work now, except that httputil.DumpRequest() still gives me the un-adjusted request, while it actually does the correct request (according to tcpdump) :)
2019-11-14 16:24:13	sztanpet	if its the form, not sure what the query has to do with it
2019-11-14 16:24:25	dupondje	sztanpet: https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Request.ParseForm
2019-11-14 16:24:48	sztanpet	so you just keep typoing it, cool
2019-11-14 16:25:19	dupondje	Well, ParseForm parses the query string, and saves it into r.Form, but adjusting r.Form doesn't make the proxied request to use the modified value
2019-11-14 16:26:07	sztanpet	of course, also the query string is only relevant with certain methods
2019-11-14 16:26:53	dupondje	Well yea, when you find it out its indeed 'of course' :D
2019-11-14 16:26:54	sztanpet	read the source of the reverse proxyer to see how it does it btw
2019-11-14 16:27:07	dupondje	yea, might be a good idea
2019-11-14 16:27:20	dupondje	and find out why the DumpRequest() doesn't print updated values
2019-11-14 16:27:31	sztanpet	you can click the type in the docs
2019-11-14 16:30:06	sztanpet	also sounds like you want the Directory member of the struct
2019-11-14 16:30:37	sztanpet	but im guessing you are currently just wrapping the handler which works also fine

2019-11-14 16:58:26	gwd	aLeSD: I'd say it depends on the access patterns.  If you're just going to read and cycle through them, no need for SQL at all -- a flat file will suffice.  If you need database functionality -- if you plan on searching for subsets of individual names, or doing complex queries, or if you need ACID update functionality, then sqlite3 makes more sense.

2019-11-15 13:04:44	trodis	HI I have a quick question. When I'm running my go program inside Visual Studi Code (Debug -> Run without debugging) the os.Getwd() function always returns my home dir, not the full path to my program. But when I run my program via terminal the os.Getwd() func return the fullpath of my .go program as it is supposed to do. Can anyone help please and tell me what to configure so that os.Getwd() also returns in vs code debugging the fullpath
2019-11-15 13:04:44	trodis	 to my executed go program? thx

2019-11-15 13:05:14	trodis	yes i figured
2019-11-15 13:05:38	sztanpet	relying on the cwd is already iffy
2019-11-15 13:05:41	Shrike	it gets all confused if you start if from the dock, can't find any environment variables etc
2019-11-15 13:05:44	trodis	but there has to be a solution for this
2019-11-15 13:05:53	Shrike	but when I start it from the project dir with 'code .', everything just works
2019-11-15 13:06:03	siXy	trodis: The only reliable solution is not to rely on the current working directory.
2019-11-15 13:06:07	Shrike	then it inherits the terminal's environment
2019-11-15 13:06:19	sztanpet	what are you trying to accomplish trodis, theres probably a better way

2019-11-15 13:07:15	Shrike	so basicaly you want to find the directory the program is running in?
2019-11-15 13:07:37	trodis	Wel I need the cwd so I dont need to hard code the path for the dir where the .go program is running. I am saving files in that dir and I want them to be saved there, regardless where the .go program is executed

2019-11-15 14:47:07	siXy	a system that encouraged approximate dependencies (this is about the only thing ruby does well) works better - lib maintainers know that they need to be careful about brekaing changes in minor vers, less dependency hell is experienced by users, and people are happier.

2019-11-15 17:43:35	hudlee	So plugins kinda do what I want but a <63 byte files turns into a 1.6MB .so file

2019-11-15 17:43:57	Tv`	you misunderstand what the plugin compilation mode does
2019-11-15 17:43:58	lupine	Welcome to go
2019-11-15 17:44:29	Tv`	hudlee: if you''re asking for binary-only libraries to distribute to your customers, that support was explicitly dropped
2019-11-15 17:44:46	siXy	hudlee: Could you expand a bit about your usecase? Problems that are effectively solved by go plugins are not common
2019-11-15 17:44:58	Tv`	hudlee: but "compiled separately and linked into a binary" describes just a regular Go package

2019-11-15 17:51:19	icholy	hudlee: are you coming from php?

2019-11-15 17:53:41	icholy	hudlee: I'm just asking because your "map url to filename" sounds a lot like webdev with php.
2019-11-15 17:54:12	guido_g	I don't get what source files have to do with urls
2019-11-15 17:54:53	hudlee	icholy: I see the web dev, which I guess to you means PHP?
2019-11-15 17:54:54	jjhoo	probably something like Controller.php that has a controller class?
2019-11-15 17:54:59	Tv`	it's a cheap trick to get going but then you end up with /user/<id> and it's no longer a filename

2019-11-18 10:32:58	daharon	KirkMcDonald, perhaps it has something to do with the fact that I'm unmarshalling this from JSON.

2019-11-18 15:03:09	hugotty	Hi, I'm looking at this example code: https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/example_test.go . On line 31 a bitwise & is used, why is this necessary? Is event.Op == fsnotify.Write not enough?
2019-11-18 15:04:09	iivvoo	I guess event.Op can contain multiple event types
2019-11-18 15:04:25	iivvoo	are you familiar with the concept of bitmasks?
2019-11-18 15:04:35	hugotty	Nope
2019-11-18 15:05:27	iivvoo	ok, so you define values as powers of two, A=1, B=2, C=4, D=8 etc

2019-11-18 15:05:44	iivvoo	by OR-ing them you get a bitmask, e.g. A | D -> 1001
2019-11-18 15:06:15	iivvoo	to check if "D" is set, you & and check for a non-0 result (or for the actual value). 1001 & D -> 1000
2019-11-18 15:06:52	iivvoo	while 1001 & C -> 0
2019-11-18 15:07:43	iivvoo	however, 1001 == 1000 would be false
2019-11-18 15:07:53	iivvoo	(it would be true if A wasn't set)
2019-11-18 15:09:28	hugotty	But Op isn't Or'ed right?
2019-11-18 15:10:06	iivvoo	you set using OR, you check using AND
2019-11-18 15:10:20	hugotty	Ah ok
2019-11-18 15:10:22	iivvoo	1000 | 0001 -> 1001; 1001 & 1000 -> 1000
2019-11-18 15:11:10	hugotty	So this declaration ORs  all possible values on assignment ? https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/fsnotify.go#L26

2019-11-18 15:13:30	iivvoo	so I wasn't familiar with the "<<" version of iota, but this defines the constants as powers of 2, so 1 2 4 etc
2019-11-18 15:14:27	iivvoo	(without it it would number sequentially, 1,2,3,4 which won't work since 3 == b11)
2019-11-18 15:14:40	iivvoo	https://yourbasic.org/golang/bitmask-flag-set-clear/ might be interesting to look at (just some google result)
2019-11-18 15:15:04	hugotty	Ooh wait I think I get it, Op can be assigned multiple values at the same time by ORing them. So  Op can be Write | Create | Remove
2019-11-18 15:15:24	iivvoo	exactly
2019-11-18 15:15:33	hugotty	and by doing Op & Write I check if Write  is one of those values

2019-11-19 13:00:16	sztanpet	dupondje are you sure you fit the usecase for sync.Map? most people only need a sync.RWMutex protected map
2019-11-19 13:01:05	napsy	from my experience, sharing maps between multiple goroutines is dangerous
2019-11-19 13:01:17	napsy	even when using mutexes
2019-11-19 13:01:31	sztanpet	how could that be the case
2019-11-19 13:01:55	napsy	simply forget to use a mutex when accessing the map
2019-11-19 13:02:02	sztanpet	wat
2019-11-19 13:02:09	sztanpet	so make your own type
2019-11-19 13:02:29	napsy	why? there's already sync.Map
2019-11-19 13:02:42	sztanpet	because you use the right tool for the job
2019-11-19 13:02:48	sztanpet	architect your software yo
2019-11-19 13:02:51	napsy	exactly my point
2019-11-19 13:03:16	sztanpet	sync.Map is usually the wrong answer if you only know that your map will be concurrently accessed
2019-11-19 13:03:34	sztanpet	as described in the docs

2019-11-20 11:42:18	sztanpet	capacity is not the same as length

2019-11-20 12:19:25	friendlyguy	so far i tried 1.11.10 to 1.11.13, all produce the same error
2019-11-20 12:19:37	Xatenev	does this channel also recommend go frameworks for a specific purpose or is that OT here?

2019-11-20 12:28:35	friendlyguy	since 1.10 is in the repos i decided to use that to compile 1.11

2019-11-20 13:21:00	Xatenev	do you guys have like a common function that does the error checks?
2019-11-20 13:21:06	sztanpet	matrixise use go modules for package management, the easiest of them all, and what kind of project template are you looking for
2019-11-20 13:21:31	Xatenev	like func err(err, msg) { if err != nil { log.Fatal(msg) }
2019-11-20 13:21:31	sztanpet	Xatenev depends, not much point to abstracting if statements
2019-11-20 13:21:41	Xatenev	sztanpet, I agree but theres so many of them
2019-11-20 13:21:46	sztanpet	that only works for the simplest program
2019-11-20 13:21:49	Xatenev	yep
2019-11-20 13:21:51	Xatenev	i wonder if theres somtehing you can do

2019-11-20 13:22:06	Xatenev	okdoke
2019-11-20 13:22:19	Xatenev	I mean, it makes the error handling very readable though
2019-11-20 13:22:21	Xatenev	compared to other languages imho
2019-11-20 13:22:55	 *	Xatenev stares at rust
2019-11-20 13:22:55	sztanpet	for sure, also its on the horizon that there will be something done to make it more pleasant
2019-11-20 13:23:16	Xatenev	cool
2019-11-20 13:23:39	Xatenev	I have another architecutiral question since im just starting out with go
2019-11-20 13:24:27	lluad	You usually want to do different things in response to an error, so handling them explicitly is clearest.
2019-11-20 13:24:34	Xatenev	basically I have a web framework (echo), but it doesn't have built-in support for databases, for every route I want the route to be automatically passed a DB handler into so i can make requests to the DB
2019-11-20 13:25:04	sztanpet	use a main struct for your app that your http handlers hang off of
2019-11-20 13:25:34	lluad	That's simplest. Using closures can work too.
2019-11-20 13:25:34	Xatenev	I now have a package "handler" and a struct `Handler` that has all routes tied to it, aswell as a DB object. and I have a `db` package
2019-11-20 13:25:41	matrixise	sztanpet: for example, a template with tests, documentation, a basic CLI, module management and maybe with Gin, I need to create a small web server in front of Kafka with validation of the incoming requests.
2019-11-20 13:25:45	Xatenev	this `db` package gets the DB object from Handler as first param
2019-11-20 13:25:49	Xatenev	is that a good way?
2019-11-20 13:26:21	Xatenev	the db package just contains functions that get the DB object from handler as first param*
2019-11-20 13:26:26	Xatenev	^ worded in a better way

First line are the headers (33 total), which are exactly the same as the column names in the table.

2019-11-20 15:44:55	jarlopez	I'm writing some methods for a struct where I don't want to modify the struct, but instead create a new one with identical properties, modify it, and return the new one. Is this a recommended way to go about this? https://play.golang.org/p/VBaL8f_3u4A
2019-11-20 15:47:43	GinjaNinja32	it *works*, but I'm not sure it's clear in intent
2019-11-20 15:47:56	GinjaNinja32	especially if Thing has pointer receivers too
2019-11-20 15:48:42	jarlopez	GinjaNinja32: Can you elaborate? In this particular case, Thing does _not_ have any pointer receiver fns
2019-11-20 15:49:39	GinjaNinja32	hm I guess line 13 is doing a copy anyway, hm
2019-11-20 15:49:52	GinjaNinja32	you don't need the `Thing( )` there though, `other := t` is enough
2019-11-20 15:50:27	GinjaNinja32	it might be copied... 3 times I think in that example, though
2019-11-20 15:50:31	GinjaNinja32	depends how smart the optimisations are
2019-11-20 15:51:13	jarlopez	GinjaNinja32: Good points. How would you approach this?
2019-11-20 15:51:38	GinjaNinja32	unsure
2019-11-20 15:51:47	GinjaNinja32	definitely 3 copies going on there though
2019-11-20 15:52:06	jarlopez	Could you point them out?
2019-11-20 15:52:22	TvL2386	I would reimplement the func WithName body with: `t.Name = name ; return t`
2019-11-20 15:52:29	TvL2386	and it would do exactly what you wanted
2019-11-20 15:52:37	TvL2386	the func already got a duplicate
2019-11-20 15:52:56	TvL2386	by not defining it as `func (t *Thing)`
2019-11-20 15:53:04	TvL2386	is what I read, but I'm noob :)
2019-11-20 15:53:51	GinjaNinja32	TvL2386, IMO that's *less* clear (you just have the two implicit copies instead of two implicit and one explicit), but maybe better? idk
2019-11-20 15:54:02	GinjaNinja32	jarlopez: one when you call WithName, one on line 13, one when you return from WithName

2019-11-20 15:56:11	jarlopez	I suppose a better way would be to make it operate on *Thing and explicitly set the fields on the new one, returning a pointer to it

2019-11-20 15:57:29	GinjaNinja32	jarlopez: if you did that, you could do `other := *t` and return `&other`, then you'd have one explicit copy and zero implicit :)

2019-11-22 09:13:22	chunkypuffs	https://github.com/Z-Bolt/OctoScreen/blob/845d348b565c55bb198e3bdf18c4956449690a54/ui/ui.go#L39
2019-11-22 09:13:51	chunkypuffs	I'm interested in the references to BackgroundTask
2019-11-22 09:14:03	chunkypuffs	L80 has this: "ui.b = NewBackgroundTask(time.Second*2, ui.update)"
2019-11-22 09:14:17	chunkypuffs	This is causing a memory leak, as the tasks are never killed.
2019-11-22 09:14:27	chunkypuffs	What is BackgroundTask, where does it come from?
2019-11-22 09:15:03	chunkypuffs	If I'm reading this right, "b" is a pointer to BackgroundTask, where does BackgroundTask get defined?
2019-11-22 09:17:12	bpalmer	chunkypuffs: it's in the same package, so it'll be in the same directory. If you grep, you'll see it's defined in common.go
2019-11-22 09:17:59	bpalmer	chunkypuffs: to shut it down, looks like you just have to remember to call Close() on it.
2019-11-22 09:18:31	chunkypuffs	Close where? In ui.go, or in common.go?
2019-11-22 09:18:47	chunkypuffs	Where am I expected to close it, the conventions in Go and C++ are still not native to me.
2019-11-22 09:19:16	chunkypuffs	In ui.go, "ui.update" runs through a bunch of stuff, and I'm losing track of where the actual calls are being made.
2019-11-22 09:19:43	bpalmer	chunkypuffs: a *BackgroundTask  has a Close() method defined. To clean up the resources for the BackgroundTask, call its Close() method.
2019-11-22 09:19:48	chunkypuffs	for example, are you suggesting I need to close it on L80 ?
2019-11-22 09:20:14	chunkypuffs	ui.b.Close() ?

2019-11-22 09:20:30	bpalmer	chunkypuffs: yes, that would close it; but L80 is where you're assigning it, so presumably you want it to do something.
2019-11-22 09:20:49	chunkypuffs	Yeah and it'd have to be conditional, right?

2019-11-22 09:21:49	bpalmer	something is calling ui.New . Whatever that thing is, should know when it's done with the *UI

2019-11-22 09:24:08	bpalmer	since the "destroy" event calls gtkquit, perhaps it's never designed to have more than one UI in the program, so there's no need to ever clean up its background task.

2019-11-22 09:25:05	bpalmer	if you are simply trying to deal with a single background task continuing to run and something is reporting it as a leak, call ui.b.Close() right before calling gtk.MainQuit
2019-11-22 09:26:01	chunkypuffs	bpalmer, I know nothing about this codebase really
2019-11-22 09:26:28	chunkypuffs	there's just a memory leak caused by opening threads that never close https://github.com/Z-Bolt/OctoScreen/issues/56
2019-11-22 09:27:20	chunkypuffs	In fact honestly that's all a bit much for my level, but I'll try a few things out

2019-11-22 12:38:27	Wessie	what is the duration in backgroundtask
2019-11-22 12:38:43	chunkypuffs	Wessie, is that an argument?
2019-11-22 12:38:53	chunkypuffs	sec, let me link it
2019-11-22 12:39:24	chunkypuffs	https://github.com/Z-Bolt/OctoScreen/issues/56
2019-11-22 12:39:47	chunkypuffs	https://github.com/Z-Bolt/OctoScreen/blob/master/ui/ui.go#L39
2019-11-22 12:40:10	chunkypuffs	https://github.com/Z-Bolt/OctoScreen/blob/845d348b565c55bb198e3bdf18c4956449690a54/ui/ui.go#L80
2019-11-22 12:40:28	Wessie	the problem seems to be that it just spawns new tasks even if one is already running
2019-11-22 12:40:31	chunkypuffs	so, L80 contains time.Second*2, ui.update
2019-11-22 12:40:44	chunkypuffs	so the background task DOES end?
2019-11-22 12:40:51	chunkypuffs	you're saying that the first argument is the max time it should live for?
2019-11-22 12:41:03	Wessie	the first argument seems to be the wait-time between calls here
2019-11-22 12:41:14	Wessie	so it repeatedly calls ui.update every 2 seconds
2019-11-22 12:41:19	chunkypuffs	It's interacting with a rest api for octoprint
2019-11-22 12:41:36	chunkypuffs	so it doesn't need to check, it just needs to kill old tasks
2019-11-22 12:42:02	chunkypuffs	how would I kill the old tasks? I don't know anything about this function, what library it's from, or how to even figure that out.
2019-11-22 12:42:08	Wessie	what is using the ui return value
2019-11-22 12:42:45	chunkypuffs	L93
2019-11-22 12:43:31	chunkypuffs	Oh, wait, I don't think I understand what you're saying.
2019-11-22 12:43:40	chunkypuffs	Return value for ui? I don't understand what that means.
2019-11-22 12:43:57	chunkypuffs	Ui is a library, no?
2019-11-22 12:43:59	Wessie	ui.New is only called in main.go it seems
2019-11-22 12:44:08	Wessie	so that can't be the leak
2019-11-22 12:44:41	chunkypuffs	Alright, well the application spawns threads endlessly, which ultimately kills Octoprint on the other end and runs IT out of memory.
2019-11-22 12:44:48	chunkypuffs	So it has something to do with api requests, because of that.
2019-11-22 12:44:58	chunkypuffs	And so I just looked in the code for where api requests were being called.
2019-11-22 12:45:26	chunkypuffs	so maybe it really is in the api library for octoprint..
2019-11-22 12:45:27	Wessie	I'm not doubting that, I'm just saying that code should never be able to spawn multiple BackgroundTasks from that code segment
2019-11-22 12:45:34	chunkypuffs	https://github.com/Z-Bolt/OctoScreen/blob/845d348b565c55bb198e3bdf18c4956449690a54/ui/ui.go#L80

2019-11-22 15:15:00	cnf	anyone know a decent module for openid-connect clientcredentials? (ie not web interactive) ?
2019-11-22 15:15:04	saml	or do tracing in head
2019-11-22 15:15:16	guido_g	https://tour.golang.org/flowcontrol/1
2019-11-22 15:16:05	saml	1 - ((1-49) / 2) = 1 - (-48/2) = 1 - -24 = 25
2019-11-22 15:16:45	guido_g	read the text at the given link
2019-11-22 15:17:00	saml	49 - (25*25) = negative number  < 0.00001
2019-11-22 15:17:14	sl33k	saml: i don't know why the formula works for the first function but can see some difference. I am doing the golang tour exercises :(
2019-11-22 15:17:18	saml	i think your math is wrong
2019-11-22 15:18:27	saml	sl33k, (z*z) - x  != x - (z*z)
2019-11-22 15:18:30	guido_g	in short: in the first function a is re-calculated
2019-11-22 15:18:46	guido_g	and that
2019-11-22 15:18:47	saml	you didn't translate it properly
2019-11-22 15:18:59	sl33k	let me read the exercise again.
2019-11-22 15:19:03	saml	you should've used monad and haskell to prevent this kind of math error
2019-11-22 15:19:20	sl33k	saml: lol i am writing java

2019-11-22 16:30:51	trodis	Hi @all I know that mozilla is putting all his Root CAs in his soruce file (cacert.pem) for the Firefox Browser. But where do I get the CAs from thunderbird? Is there any kind of ressource? Or do I have to extract them directly from thunderbird?
2019-11-22 16:30:51	+smw	sl33k, actually, in this case it will always do what you expect, but that is just because you use Sat and Thurs. Try figuring out how far Sunday :-)
2019-11-22 16:31:10	Jmainguy	subtracting Wednesday from Thursday is the type of stuff I do in my dreams, like programming excercises with wierd stuff
2019-11-22 16:31:23	+smw	sl33k, weekday is defined here: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Weekday
2019-11-22 16:31:28	Jmainguy	I definitly think learning to code changes how your brain works
2019-11-22 16:32:12	+smw	Jmainguy, I once dealt with ruby code that I couldn't figure out what it did. It got a range over input to input
2019-11-22 16:32:24	+smw	err, input over input +3, then did stuff
2019-11-22 16:32:34	+smw	later, I found out it expects dates...
2019-11-22 16:32:52	+smw	and math on dates works as if days were integers
2019-11-22 16:33:32	+smw	sl33k, anyways, we have no operator overloading in Go, so adding and subtracting really isn't a great plan :-)

2019-11-22 16:34:59	+smw	sl33k, I think you want abs((a - b) % 7)
2019-11-22 16:35:33	+smw	where a and b are dates and the output is number of days until the next time a == b.
2019-11-22 16:36:13	saml	do you use linux at work? how do you get vpn working?
2019-11-22 16:37:03	+smw	saml, ?
2019-11-22 16:37:22	+smw	trodis, thunderbird uses the same root CAs as firefox afaik

2019-11-25 10:41:33	elichai2	Is there a good guide for cgo best practices? i've been doing a lot of FFI in rust and I know how fragile it can be, so I want to read a lot before attempting to do it (i.e. is there unwinding in go? C alignments?)
2019-11-25 10:42:43	fleaz	Hey everyone. I have a repo which contains 4 applications in subfolders. everything is working fine but now I created an additional folder called "library" where i wanted to store the shared code between all the 4 other apps. But now 'go build' wants to download $repo/library from github but this folder isn't there obviously. On SO i found the "replace" keyword to voerwrite stuff in my go.mod
2019-11-25 10:42:45	fleaz	file. Is this the right way to do? Because I feel like go ignores everything i write in there :(

2019-11-25 14:53:57	sl33k	above is verbose, but is better than nothing i guess. I'm ore used to if (m["answer"]) {} or if m.containsKey("answer")
2019-11-25 14:54:27	sl33k	bpalmer: arithmetic if is something like isEnabled := m["answer"]? true: false

2019-11-25 14:55:24	mrig	You could use `if m[enum] {}`

2019-11-25 14:56:23	mrig	yes me too, hang on I will post.
2019-11-25 14:56:34	Wessie	that only works if the value in the map is a bool
2019-11-25 14:56:40	Wessie	Go does not have a ternary operator
2019-11-25 14:56:44	bpalmer	sl33k: I usually hear that described as 'ternary conditional', and no, go doesn't have that.
2019-11-25 14:57:21	sl33k	bpalmer: yeah ternary operator, same thing :)
2019-11-25 14:57:35	Wessie	they're similar but not the same
2019-11-25 14:57:42	sl33k	Wessie: so a longer traditional if statement instead?
2019-11-25 14:57:57	Wessie	yeah, the example bpalmer gave is as short as you're going to get it probably

2019-11-25 14:58:58	mrig	sl33k very simply https://play.golang.org/p/8aQvwU1E67r
2019-11-25 14:58:58	bpalmer	sl33k: if you can set up your map so the default value of your type expresses what you want to do if there is no element there, you can simply do something like `m := make(map[string]bool) ; isEnabled = m["answer"]`. That way isEnabled is false unless you've inserted a true value
2019-11-25 15:00:30	sl33k	bpalmer: yeah i follow. Don't want to whine as this forces you to only store boolean values in the map as well. But I get the overall lesson you are showing here.
2019-11-25 15:00:50	sl33k	I think it doesn't help that golang doesn't really have the concept of a truthy value

2019-11-25 15:41:22	bpalmer	bkq: append(p, b)   <-- returns a new slice, which may be able to re-use some of the memory for p and may not.

2019-11-25 15:41:35	bpalmer	you wouldn't affect the slice that the caller used.

2019-11-25 16:00:51	sztanpet	too clear, not enough abstractions
2019-11-25 16:00:53	sl33k	bkq: its just the difference between languages you tell "what to do" versus "how to do it". Heard this in some functional talk, and if you write say elixir, JS or Java in functional way your thinking differents
2019-11-25 16:01:31	sl33k	it becomes obvious when you want to pipe several operations via the map..
2019-11-25 16:06:36	bpalmer	type words []string ; func (ws words) Count() map[string]int { m :=make(map[string]int);  for _, w := range ws { m[w] += 1} return m }    , so now you get to write words(strings.Fields(s)).Count();  or write a func (ws words) Map(f func(string)) { ... }  so you can do m := make(map[string]int); words(strings.Fields(s)).Map(func(w) { m[w] += 1 })
2019-11-25 16:07:26	bpalmer	did that actually improve anything? Go supports it.
2019-11-25 16:08:56	bpalmer	that should be .Map(func(w string) { m[w] += 1}), of course

2019-11-25 16:20:38	bpalmer	it's easy to write things like a Reduce() function for a custom slice type; the overhead for doing it 'generically' for all slice types makes it unreasonable.
2019-11-25 16:21:39	bpalmer	but things like map/filter/reduce are just idioms, ones that go does not embrace warmly.

2019-11-25 17:04:07	fub	Im trying to make a function which returns a list of each subdomain of a domain. so foo.bar.foobar.com should return "bar.foobar.com" and "foobar.com". I have the feeling I am overcomplicating this but I cant come up with a simpler solution: https://play.golang.org/p/JUCxs3x3BjR any suggestions appreciated
2019-11-25 17:05:09	sztanpet	a regex would be clearer here
2019-11-25 17:06:21	fub	sztanpet: but I do not know the amount of sub-parts in the domain
2019-11-25 17:06:23	sztanpet	also why dont you split once
2019-11-25 17:06:53	sztanpet	true, yea, regex out of the question

2019-11-25 17:17:24	bpalmer	why not slice the string at periods rather than Split and Joining?
2019-11-25 17:18:03	bpalmer	slightly more tedious to write, admittedly.

2019-11-25 17:19:19	siXy	unless you're doing this tens of millions of times, though, just pick one you like the look of and go with it.
2019-11-25 17:20:11	siXy	if you are, do it by searching the string for period characters, then return slices of it.
2019-11-25 17:20:39	siXy	it'll be more hassle to write, but I'd bet a drink of your choice it'll be faster than any of these
2019-11-25 17:20:51	edrocks	fub good case to try out the test package to make sure this does what you think
2019-11-25 17:20:57	fub	Im more in the thousand executions than millions, so I dont need to over optimize this I think
2019-11-25 17:21:03	fub	edrocks: yeah I am currently writing tests for it :)
2019-11-25 17:21:04	 *	siXy nods
2019-11-25 17:21:22	fub	this is the first project Im writing _a lot_ of tests and it already saved me a lot of times
2019-11-25 17:21:29	bpalmer	also remember to handle a terminal period; presumably "foo." should be "foo" and not ""
2019-11-25 17:21:39	bpalmer	should result in "foo" and not "", I mean.
2019-11-25 17:22:48	edrocks	bpalmer is there a reason things support a terminal period? I've seen it a couple times with local host stuff

2019-11-25 17:23:59	edrocks	oh so `something.com` is technically `something.com.` aka com is a subdomain of the root `.`
2019-11-25 17:24:16	sztanpet	yea, even the browsers support it
2019-11-25 17:24:18	bpalmer	moreover, "Some applications, such as web browsers, try to resolve the domain name part of a uniform resource locator (URL) if the resolver cannot find the specified domain or if it is clearly not fully qualified by appending frequently used top-level domains and testing the result"
2019-11-25 17:24:29	sztanpet	there was even some vulnerability about this
2019-11-25 17:24:36	bpalmer	Typically adding a terminal  . stops that behavior

2019-11-25 17:26:18	fub	Some other question: I made a function which adds an "Asset". Creates the struct with some default values, executes an INSERT, does some error checking.
2019-11-25 17:26:48	edrocks	fub what are you making with all this btw?
2019-11-25 17:26:51	fub	I currently have an if !isValidDomain(d) {return errInvalid} in this addAsset() func. Does this make sense or would it make more sense to put the validation outside?
2019-11-25 17:27:29	fub	edrocks: its an asset monitoring tool
2019-11-25 17:27:43	edrocks	if you can validate before insert like you have that is a good practice but you have to control all the inserts
2019-11-25 17:28:36	edrocks	also you may want `url.Parse` plus maybe the host field from it's output

2019-11-26 17:49:18	Tv`	use your data types, don't program Go like it was JS/Ruby/Python/whatever
2019-11-26 17:50:03	Tv`	there's very few scenarios where interface{} actually is the answer, and those are mostly around things like fmt.Printf and json.Marshal, where that function uses reflection to work its magic

2019-11-29 16:27:57	bodqhrohro	Huh, a.(*B) works. Interesting.
2019-11-29 16:29:04	bodqhrohro	So interfaces may be asserted to types and to pointers on types the same way?
2019-11-29 16:29:09	icholy	bodqhrohro: It's a safety mechanism to prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot
2019-11-29 16:30:44	siXy	bodqhrohro: Your func d makes me suspect you're slightly misunderstanding what an interface is.
2019-11-29 16:34:00	siXy	bodqhrohro: Think of an interface like a contract. foo := new(B) implicitly complies with the contract defined by interface A, as both have a method C(). It's rare that expicitly convertinging back from an interface to a concrete type is the correct thing to do, and it's more usually a symptom of not quite getting the model

2019-12-02 14:33:24	sztanpet	sure, most of the issues i seen in the channel were just rtfm issues tho
2019-12-02 14:33:37	sztanpet	admittedly not all
2019-12-02 14:36:28	lluad	They're train-wrecky in that none of the tooling supports them.
2019-12-02 14:37:03	lluad	"none" might be a bit strong. "none of the tooling that actually works reliably supports them" would be fairer.
2019-12-02 14:37:05	sztanpet	ah, i would call that an ecosystem issue
2019-12-02 14:37:28	dominikh	the majority of worthwhile tooling has been updated to work with modules.
2019-12-02 14:37:39	lluad	Really?
2019-12-02 14:37:44	dominikh	throw an example at me
2019-12-02 14:37:58	sztanpet	i dont have problems either with modules or with the tooling but my usecases are simple
2019-12-02 14:38:42	sztanpet	gorename! that almost didnt work until i just cleaned out my gopath
2019-12-02 14:39:01	lluad	Most everything that gopls tries to replace

2019-12-02 14:40:21	lluad	i.e. If my IDE uses gopls it's buggy and needs restarting all the time. If it doesn't use gopls it works perfectly with non-module code, but not so much with module using code.
2019-12-02 14:40:52	dominikh	most everything that gopls tries to replace is replaced by gopls… it works pretty well for most people at this point. for people who object to change, https://github.com/stamblerre/gocode is a copy of gocode with module support, vet, staticcheck etc all support modules, and I cannot remember anything else gopls currently does that existed as a tool before
2019-12-02 14:41:05	dominikh	I do recommend updating gopls regularly for fewer bugs
2019-12-02 14:41:24	lluad	Yup. And it's getting _better_. But it's still a long way from bug free.
2019-12-02 14:41:28	sztanpet	yea, there were quite a few major fixes "recently"
2019-12-02 14:41:40	dominikh	yes, gopls is still rocky and alpha, but it's definitely a very small subset of "all the tooling"
2019-12-02 14:42:20	dominikh	all maintained linters and code gen and what have you likely support modules at this point
2019-12-02 14:42:53	dominikh	(the same can't be said for unmaintained tools, obviously. and guru will be missed.)
2019-12-02 14:43:01	lluad	It's mostly IDE tooling that I notice, and that's just reaching "usable" in the past couple of months.
2019-12-02 14:43:39	dominikh	yes, I'll grant you that. but also, aside from gocode and godef, none of it really existed before :P
2019-12-02 14:44:01	dominikh	(also I believe godef does work with modules)
2019-12-02 14:44:47	lluad	But I'm still using modules, in code both old and new.
2019-12-02 14:44:52	lluad	:shrug:
2019-12-02 14:47:07	sztanpet	i find it annoying the amount of FUD there is about modules without a good enough reason
2019-12-02 14:47:48	dominikh	most of it isn't so much "without a good reason" and more "with outdated reasons"
2019-12-02 14:47:58	dominikh	first impressions stick around

2019-12-02 14:49:04	dominikh	eh, I think they're the least bad implementation so far, compared to other languages. still inferior to GOPATH, of course, but people disagree with me on that part
2019-12-02 14:49:08	sztanpet	of what?
2019-12-02 14:49:23	bkq	dominikh i agree with you here, im a big fan of GOPATH
2019-12-02 14:49:26	lluad	Versions in path names, special casing to be backwards compatible with non-module code. It's all very hacky.

2019-12-02 15:05:20	lluad	The lack of dependency management was kind of a problem.
2019-12-02 15:05:31	lluad	It still is, of course, just differently.
2019-12-02 15:05:33	Freman	I never had an issue with it :D

2019-12-03 12:10:29	cmrabet	Coming from other languages and platforms, this packages thing is one of the worsts limitations of GO. Just my opinion. Better way is allowing imports and exports the same way other languages do.
2019-12-03 12:12:25	KirkMcDonald	Which same way? This is an area in which languages tend to express a certain amount of diversity.

2019-12-03 14:06:45	Gaffel	The tag or hash, doesn't matter.
2019-12-03 14:07:03	bkq	use the linker to do that
2019-12-03 14:07:16	Gaffel	It's supposed to do it automatically when you use go modules.
2019-12-03 14:07:35	bkq	go build -ldflags "-X main.Build=$(git rev-parse HEAD) main.Tag=$(git describe --abbrev=0)"
2019-12-03 14:07:51	bkq	this will work, assuming you have two string variables called Build and Tag in the main package

2019-12-03 14:08:26	Gaffel	Yeah, but that doesn't expose the variables where I want them. debug.ReadBuildInfo

2019-12-03 14:09:26	Gaffel	So how do I set it?
2019-12-03 14:09:33	bkq	ReadBuildInfo returns information about the modules in the build, it won't return information about the git code itself
2019-12-03 14:09:51	bkq	you can't set it, unless you override what is returned
2019-12-03 14:10:35	dominikh	modules have versions, which indirectly map to git commits. the issue is that ReadBuildInfo only provides version information for dependencies, not the main module.
2019-12-03 14:10:43	Gaffel	Prometheus calls that function and exports the information.
2019-12-03 14:10:53	Gaffel	It's supposed to include main's version
2019-12-03 14:11:50	dominikh	also relevant: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/29814

2019-12-03 14:16:43	Gaffel	Thanks, I just found it all very confusion. It's supposed to work but it doesn't. Thanks :)
2019-12-03 14:17:19	Gaffel	The documentation indicated that it's supposed to work right now but I guess not.
2019-12-03 14:17:28	dominikh	it works, given certain constraints.
2019-12-03 14:17:34	Gaffel	If main is in the root?
2019-12-03 14:17:55	dominikh	if you're not interested in the version of the main module. you can inspect the versions of your dependencies.
2019-12-03 14:18:28	dominikh	(by extension, if some module has your module as its dependency, it will be able to inspect the version of your module)
2019-12-03 14:18:32	Gaffel	Yeah, but I just want my binary to be trackable back to the exact repo and commit/tag.
2019-12-03 14:18:33	dominikh	you just cannot inspect yourself
2019-12-03 14:18:41	Gaffel	aaah, okay.
2019-12-03 14:19:03	dominikh	this does lead to a somewhat hacky workaround, of course
2019-12-03 14:19:14	Gaffel	Yeah, I'd avoid that.
2019-12-03 14:19:17	dominikh	introduce a new module that depends on your actual module, and build the binaries inside that module
2019-12-03 14:19:40	dominikh	but that's a bit convoluted.
2019-12-03 14:19:54	Gaffel	Yes, I agree. That's not what I want. :P
2019-12-03 14:20:16	dominikh	other than that, and homegrown versioning, you can only wait for #29814 to be implemented
2019-12-03 14:20:45	Gaffel	Yeah. I hope it won't take too long. :)
2019-12-03 14:20:56	dominikh	which won't happen for 1.14, so you're waiting at least another 6 months after the release of 1.14
2019-12-03 14:21:03	Gaffel	I see :(

2019-12-03 14:51:53	adrian_1908	Why is GOPATH needed? Is it so that installe packages can find each other, avoiding duplication? In other languages, you just write your code and invoke the compiler whereever you need it.

2019-12-03 15:00:12	adrian_1908	bkq: So basically, all your projects would sit in the GOPATH directory, not just shared/common dependencies, yes? And do I understand it right that modules are basically mainstream now, aside from projects stuck on LTS constraints?

2019-12-03 17:25:04	siXy	By choosing a data model that properly represents our actual data set, we can then define simple methods that operate on it, so the caller doesn't need to know any details about what's going on behind the scenes
2019-12-03 17:25:20	GrandMoffTarkin	I agree
2019-12-03 17:25:32	siXy	This is what I meant earlier about choosing a better data structure - once you have that right, the rest of the code often becomes trivial to write correctly

2019-12-04 13:18:24	sztanpet	with go get
2019-12-04 13:18:33	dominikh	you can run `go get`, but any command that needs the deps, such as go build, will do it automatically

2019-12-04 13:19:17	setpill	-_- why is that not documented on https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules ? it says "go get changes the required version of a dependency (or adds a new dependency)"
2019-12-04 13:19:33	sztanpet	maybe a better question would be: why do you think you need to install the dependencies
2019-12-04 13:19:38	-->	con3 (~kvirc@165.255.106.186) has joined #go-nuts
2019-12-04 13:19:51	setpill	because running `protoc` does not install it automatically
2019-12-04 13:21:14	sztanpet	yup, that does not
2019-12-04 13:21:26	dominikh	sounds to me like protoc should be improved.
2019-12-04 13:22:18	sztanpet	setpill also, a rational for not mentioning it there is because that post is about creating modules
2019-12-04 13:22:46	dominikh	really, the post demonstrates that doing anything will download the deps, such as 'go test' just working
2019-12-04 13:22:46	setpill	very confusing usage of the word "using" then
2019-12-04 13:23:02	dominikh	whether you run build, test or list really doesn't matter in the end
2019-12-04 13:23:19	dominikh	(neither does it matter for most tools that have been updated; they, too, will automatically fetch the deps)
2019-12-04 13:23:30	dominikh	so it's pretty much protoc that's being special here
2019-12-04 13:25:17	bpalmer	well, protoc is a generic tool, not really part of the go ecosystem
2019-12-04 13:25:55	dominikh	sure, but it interacts with the build system
2019-12-04 13:28:22	aceeri_	hmm
2019-12-04 13:29:08	aceeri_	Why does this (https://godoc.org/github.com/streadway/amqp#Channel.Consume) say that you *must* range over the channel?
2019-12-04 13:29:27	aceeri_	I checked the source and where they send over the channel it is blocking
2019-12-04 13:29:41	aceeri_	so how would that lose events over that channel?
2019-12-04 13:30:02	<--	mikami (~scurfee@mail.dveriunion.ru) has quit
2019-12-04 13:30:10	aceeri_	As in it is doing a `chan <- msg` rather than `select { case chan <-msg: default: }`
2019-12-04 13:30:27	sztanpet	the point is to read all the data from the channel
2019-12-04 13:31:02	dominikh	"Unreceived deliveries will block all methods on the same connection" is the important part there.
2019-12-04 13:31:10	aceeri_	hmm
2019-12-04 13:31:23	aceeri_	I see
2019-12-04 13:31:46	aceeri_	so it isn't ensuring that all deliveries are received, it is more about not stepping on the toes of other channels using the same connection
2019-12-04 13:32:17	dominikh	it's about not stalling, yes

2019-12-04 14:02:59	sztanpet	they are numbers tho, why not just store them properly, just not as floats?
2019-12-04 14:03:03	dominikh	what will you do with strings when you need to do math on them?
2019-12-04 14:03:04	sztanpet	maybe fixed width decimals?

2019-12-04 14:04:28	dominikh	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic for something more appropriate than a random MySQL tutorial
2019-12-04 14:04:57	dominikh	anyway, there are multiple ways of storing money, depending on your needs, the precision needed and magnitudes involved.
2019-12-04 14:05:10	sztanpet	i made an assumption that you must be using mysql :)
2019-12-04 14:05:24	iivvoo	https://0.30000000000000004.com/
2019-12-04 14:05:58	iivvoo	not sure how relevant to the floating point discussion, but ran into that site this week (like many probably :)
2019-12-04 14:06:41	dominikh	for example, one could store cents/millicents/... depending on precision required. that might fit just fine into 64 bit depending on your magnitudes. if you need arbitrary precision, something like big.Rat might be applicable.
2019-12-04 14:08:43	rbotoml	dominikh: Yeah the payment processors I have used do that
2019-12-04 14:08:45	dominikh	(and big decimals, and decimal floats and a number of other things, I'm not an expert on handling money, either)
2019-12-04 14:09:13	rbotoml	You see, I'm trying to work out the conversion rate from USD EUR. And the rate itself has may decimals points
2019-12-04 14:09:17	dominikh	but for your common online web store, expressing prices in cents is probably just fine; I don't think tax rates etc need more precision than that
2019-12-04 14:09:27	dominikh	ah, well
2019-12-04 14:09:28	rbotoml	I guess, I need to always factor in some inacrery
2019-12-04 14:09:41	dominikh	I mean, the exchange rate itself is only exact to N digits
2019-12-04 14:10:08	dominikh	(and it's definitely not a floating point :P)
2019-12-04 14:10:40	dominikh	I'd be shocked if there wasn't a stackoverflow answer talking about exchange rates

2019-12-04 15:37:54	SamWhited	Well, `go help mod vendor' mentions test code, but not other things and I'm pretty sure that's not all it skips.

2019-12-04 15:39:19	SamWhited	sztanpet: thanks, that page doesn't mention what files are put into vendor or not though, or am I just missing it? Thought I'd read that whole thing
2019-12-04 15:39:44	dominikh	in general, it vendors what is necessary for `go build` of the packages in your module to work.
2019-12-04 15:39:55	dominikh	anything else may or may not end up in there
2019-12-04 15:40:26	SamWhited	Oh wow, I'm going to be sad if that's the extent of the contract. Is that written down anywhere?
2019-12-04 15:40:40	dominikh	maybe, but I couldn't tell you where off the top of my head
2019-12-04 15:40:49	SamWhited	Yah, we're in the same boat then :)
2019-12-04 15:41:11	siXy	SamWhited: What things would you like to be vendored that wouldn't be required for go build to work?
2019-12-04 15:41:43	sztanpet	i would expect everything to be vendored tbh
2019-12-04 15:41:46	SamWhited	siXy: I just want to know where it's documented, I don't have any particular requirements that I want to enforce.
2019-12-04 15:42:31	SamWhited	I could be wrong and it *does* vendor everything now (except tests as mentioned in go mod help), because I'm seeing README's and things now, but it definitely used to leave those out. I can find individual mailing list conversations about adding and removing certain files, but I guess they really haven't written down the behavior anywhere
2019-12-04 15:42:39	dominikh	well, in that case, `go help mod vendor` does state the contract
2019-12-04 15:43:03	dominikh	it's probably not as strictly documented as you'd like it to, no
2019-12-04 15:43:05	SamWhited	Yah, maybe I'm wrong and that is where it's documented and it's just changed. I hadn't actually considered that.
2019-12-04 15:43:45	SamWhited	hmm, no, go1.11.13 help mod vendor says the same thing, and I'm pretty sure it didn't vendor all kinds of things. Oh well, thanks anyways, guess it's not actually documented.
2019-12-04 15:44:11	siXy	I feel like relying overly heavily on exactly which of these extra files are included is a really bad idea in any case.

2019-12-04 16:23:35	jenia	what is the flag variable in the docs: https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/pprof/
2019-12-04 16:23:59	jenia	they have things like `flag.String`. Where does flag come from?
2019-12-04 16:24:02	siXy	jenia: It's the flag package, not a variable.
2019-12-04 16:24:44	siXy	jenia: Have you done tour.golang.org yet? It's very very useful when learning the language.
2019-12-04 16:25:25	jenia	siXy, thanks kindly. I did but I dont remember the profiler examples
2019-12-04 16:28:49	guido_g	it's more about language basics
2019-12-04 16:29:09	icholy	does the tour cover the flags package?
2019-12-04 16:29:25	sztanpet	its not about the profiler but about understanding go code
2019-12-04 16:29:38	dominikh	the tour covers the concept of packages and imports…
2019-12-04 16:29:40	guido_g	I'm not sure, but it does cover packages and how they are used
2019-12-04 16:30:04	SamWhited	Without the import lines it's not really possible to tell whether this is a variable defined outside this incomplete example, or a package, so if you're not very familiar with the standard library it seems easy enough to mix the two up :)
2019-12-04 16:30:06	icholy	but to be fare, that example doesn't show the imports
2019-12-04 16:30:25	SamWhited	jenia: for future reference, this is what they're using there: https://golang.org/pkg/flag/

2019-12-05 10:32:13	fuchstronaut	Just by skimping over it, if I can have one handle err block instead of 10 if err != nil's,  I'd take it I think
2019-12-05 10:32:43	Xatenev	heh
2019-12-05 10:32:51	shadowchaser	Xatenev i'm maniac of cli, so i'm getting whatever i can via api and displaying it there; perfect for twitter as i can sort tweets by date instead of random choice presented by twitter app
2019-12-05 10:33:18	Xatenev	shadowchaser, you mean you wrote a cli twitter interface?
2019-12-05 10:33:23	Xatenev	.. or atleast a reader
2019-12-05 10:33:30	shadowchaser	Xatenev just a reader

2019-12-05 15:55:56	eyJhb	If I have a interface with multiple implementations of it, how would I go about testing it? I don't want to just copy/paste the same tests in the two different implementations, but rather have e.g. a folder "test/", which has all the "*_test.go" files, which will the initialise one interface implementaiton at a time. But is this good/bad practice?

2019-12-05 16:09:04	siXy	it's slightly tough to answer your question in the abstract, because it's not clear exactly what you're trying to test and why, but the most obvious response is to use table driven tests to allow you to plug all your implementations into the same set of basic tests, with then separate tests for the implementation specific bits.

2019-12-05 17:20:04	saml	you always write before you close.
2019-12-05 17:20:24	saml	if you're a close writer, you may actually be a reader

2019-12-05 17:21:25	siXy	seebs: It's primarily a writer that also has a closer. An interface that primarily exists to close, but also supports writing, is fundamentally silly and this is why we call it a WriteCloser not a CloseWriter.

2019-12-06 12:09:39	Tichodroma	Open an issue.
2019-12-06 12:10:05	beshoo	You need to have packr2 in the path

2019-12-09 09:42:35	Symmetria	So - question - plugin architecture... if I import a plugin into a package thats not "main" - I can do the symbol lookup . the issue then becomes actually doing the assertion on the returned interface - because the methods attached are in *main.symbolname
2019-12-09 09:43:53	Symmetria	are there any fancy ways around this - I mean - I can go back to the interface header and see if I can access the stuff directly - but Im struggling to figure out how they address the methods - because in theory if I can find the right pointer I should be able to cast it to locally defined version of the same type

2019-12-09 09:51:00	KirkMcDonald	Symmetria: Even if you were in the main package, if the type is one defined in the plugin, I don't believe it would be visible. (The static type would not be available at compile-time.)
2019-12-09 09:52:19	KirkMcDonald	Can you assert that the value is of an interface type whose methods are what you need?
2019-12-09 09:52:31	Symmetria	Kirk - heh - well, I can call the functions returned by the plugin using reflect.ValueOf(pptr).MethodByName(fname).Call(arguments) if I pass the returned symbols to a function as an interface (pptr) and give it the function name
2019-12-09 09:53:12	KirkMcDonald	So why not just: type I interface { Fname() }
2019-12-09 09:53:22	Symmetria	and that then returns me a an array of []reflect.Value - which I can iterate through and access
2019-12-09 09:53:23	KirkMcDonald	And then pptr.(I)
2019-12-09 09:54:00	KirkMcDonald	(Except with the proper arguments and return type(s), etc.)

2019-12-09 10:02:10	KirkMcDonald	You may need to use reflection to dereference a pointer.
2019-12-09 10:02:37	KirkMcDonald	Or ensure that the type of the variable exported by the plugin is something you *can* assert to (like interface{}).
2019-12-09 10:02:59	KirkMcDonald	Because what the plugin package gives you is a *pointer* to that variable.

2019-12-09 10:13:16	KirkMcDonald	And let's call the value x, just for simplicity.
2019-12-09 10:13:21	Symmetria	type open interface { Unmarshal(in []byte) (*pls.BGP_OPEN_PACKET,error) } <=== something like that?
2019-12-09 10:13:29	KirkMcDonald	Sure.
2019-12-09 10:13:50	KirkMcDonald	You should be able to do something like: reflect.ValueOf(x).Elem().Interface().(I)
2019-12-09 10:13:59	Symmetria	mm lemme try that
2019-12-09 10:16:46	Symmetria	wooooot thanks mate - been really struggling with this one
2019-12-09 10:17:04	KirkMcDonald	Yeah, I did not appreciate at first that what plugin gives you is a pointer to the variable.
2019-12-09 10:17:29	KirkMcDonald	So you have to jump through that hoop to dereference it, before you can assert it to some actually-useful interface type.
2019-12-09 10:18:50	KirkMcDonald	Unless you were you ensure that the variable is, like, an interface{} in the first place, in which case you could just: (*x.(*interface{})).(I)

2019-12-09 10:22:01	Symmetria	interesting - if I try and assert to a type from another package - it fail as well so for example - with that open t ype above - it works fine - if I move that type exactly as defined into the shared package - and assert .(prefix_shared.OPEN_METHODS)
2019-12-09 10:22:02	Symmetria	it fails
2019-12-09 10:23:12	Symmetria	panic: interface conversion: main.functions is not plugin_shared.BGP_OPEN_METHODS: missing method Unmarshal
2019-12-09 10:23:13	Symmetria	get that
2019-12-09 10:24:31	KirkMcDonald	I have this idea that when the plugin imports a package, it is getting a "different" package than what your program has when *it* imports it, even if they are precisely the same code.
2019-12-09 10:25:17	KirkMcDonald	But I frankly don't know enough about plugins to say for sure.
2019-12-09 10:25:55	Symmetria	got it - heh - that last error - was just - confusing - basically the method I had declared in the prefix_shared - I'd screwed up and the argument type for the function was different - now it works fine
2019-12-09 10:25:55	KirkMcDonald	Hmm, actually, the docs seem to suggest this is not so.
2019-12-09 10:25:57	Symmetria	finally!
2019-12-09 10:26:06	KirkMcDonald	Ah ha
2019-12-09 10:26:16	Symmetria	    bgp_open, err := plugin.Open(pls.BGP_TYPE_PLUGINS[pls.BGP_OPEN_TYPE])

2019-12-09 10:26:17	KirkMcDonald	Good. This means plugins are more useful than I was fearing, there.

2019-12-09 11:41:06	[jasper]	and I use that function on a struct like c.output() ....for some reason the c.id seems to be a local variable inside the method only
2019-12-09 11:41:10	[jasper]	is this normal go behaviour?
2019-12-09 11:41:40	bkq	yes because you're using a value receiver instead of a pointer receiver

2019-12-09 14:10:08	siXy	you might also use a pointer if your struct is very large, but if you want a rule of thumb for when to do that you will be disappointed I'm afraid - it's very dependent on what you're doing if a pointer deref will be cheaper than a memcpy.
2019-12-09 14:10:12	sztanpet	the size of arguments where copying becomes less efficient than the working with the extra indirection from the pointer is surprisingly large and changes based on architecture

2019-12-09 14:16:21	mrig	right, yes the runtime is working with the data in ways that make this very close either way, that is fine, I was just wondering about best practice, so here it really is about code preferences for readability and legibility.

2019-12-09 14:17:51	llorllale	mrig: the overwhelming pattern by convention is to pass pointers around, regardless of their efficiency
2019-12-09 14:18:04	mrig	Thank you, yes I was surprised that even when passing massive strings about the behaviour seemed to be the same, I just had a doubt as to whether this was normal functionality or due to some optimisation and my poor writing of tests.
2019-12-09 14:18:22	llorllale	still though, it's a good question. most assume that pointers are more efficient by default.
2019-12-09 14:18:24	sztanpet	strings are pointers
2019-12-09 14:18:52	sztanpet	just like slices and maps are
2019-12-09 14:19:01	mrig	llorllale: yes if the data is going to be changed, pass a pointer. If it is in a goroutine, pass the data in.
2019-12-09 14:19:29	sztanpet	if in doubt, https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#SliceHeader https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#StringHeader
2019-12-09 14:19:44	kurahaupo	llorllale: that's a dirty habit inherited from Java, which by design prevented passing by value
2019-12-09 14:19:49	mrig	sztanpet: oh yes of course they are I forget about the slice abstraction still some times.
2019-12-09 14:20:04	mrig	yes the header, really cool device.
2019-12-09 14:21:18	mrig	passing by value in c has some advantages when the data is small, this was why the thought was there I think. This clears up the thought nicely though; Thank you.

2019-12-09 16:30:10	ssd532_	I'm really sorry guys but I'm trying to get my head around it.
2019-12-09 16:30:10	ssd532_	why would removing a field from protobuf not affect the consumer but affect in the case of JSON it would not? A schema is a schema. The procuder and the consumer are decoupled. The developer typically code the schema in the code. Change in the value would affect either party.
2019-12-09 16:30:10	ssd532_	Now elichai2 mentioned that *protobuf never change fields* Can you elaborate that, please?
2019-12-09 16:30:41	elichai2	the way protobuf is built is by having defaults and immutable fields
2019-12-09 16:30:43	ssd532_	* in the case of JSON it would
2019-12-09 16:31:03	elichai2	you can obviously violate the "rules" and change the schema in a more breaking way
2019-12-09 16:31:11	sztanpet	ssd532_ if your code knows about a field, that field will be there, if it doesnt, it will still accept the payload but just it will deal with the fields it knows about
2019-12-09 16:31:46	ssd532_	Oh, wait. Is it about static typing?
2019-12-09 16:32:06	siXy	ssd532_: As a protobuf developer, you don't change existing fields, you just add new ones. Thus the proto format remains forwards and backwards compatible. Same for ENUMs: the first field is always UNKNOWN so that you can add enum values later and older code will just handle it as an unknown value.
2019-12-09 16:32:13	ssd532_	in js you can deserialize any json and access any fields that you know
2019-12-09 16:33:49	ssd532_	siXy, and what if I _want_ to remove a field?
2019-12-09 16:34:15	elichai2	Kanibal: "Note that changes to files in other directories do not cause the package to be recompiled, so all non-Go source code for the package should be stored in the package directory, not in subdirectories." hmm

2019-12-09 16:43:19	ssd532_	Removing a field from a JSON when my program is Javascript will not cause any problem if I am not actually consuming the deleted field. So my question is it about static typing of Go that backward+forward compatibility of data exchange format is so important?

2019-12-09 16:47:03	siXy	ssd532_: protobufs work slightly differently - the definition of them is compiled into your app. json is by default just a best-effort mishmash of stuff. so if you change the protobuf def you need to recompile. that said, you'll tend to find as you work on larger projects with more developers involved, that it becomes very hard to work out if a field is actually still needed or not, and it's far better to
2019-12-09 16:47:09	siXy	follow the rules and keep the field present. after all, a field that's included in the protobuf doesn't have to be set to anything - there's no real advantage to deleting the field definition.

2019-12-10 10:27:04	ahljoh	Hi, I want to use a map[float]int but I am concerned that float equality is not useful to me. I need instead a soft equality that allows for tounding issues "abs(a-b) < eps"
2019-12-10 10:27:19	ahljoh	Has anyone had this issue and come up with a good solution?
2019-12-10 10:28:17	ahljoh	I was thinking of doing calculations in float64 and hashing in float32, but I am not confident of the edge cases of such a use, and it also doesnt resolve the +0 vs. -0 representations

2019-12-10 10:29:34	ahljoh	Alternative would be to use a non-builtin Map with a custom Cmp function, but I believe that involves a lot of reflection, interface{} stuff
2019-12-10 10:29:46	ahljoh	I would be grateful for any ideas

2019-12-10 10:38:58	lemmi	i'd probably take a power of two, but yeah
2019-12-10 10:39:33	lemmi	or do some bittwiddling and zero the lower most couple of bite of the mantissa
2019-12-10 10:40:18	lemmi	it's not pretty, but i'll kind of do what you want
2019-12-10 10:40:44	ahljoh	Also, rounding could go into the wrong direction
2019-12-10 10:41:05	ahljoh	0.004 => 0.000
2019-12-10 10:41:17	ahljoh	0.005 => 0.0010
2019-12-10 10:41:36	ahljoh	But i guess i can accommodate that with less harsh rounding
2019-12-10 10:42:02	lemmi	this won't be pretty in any case
2019-12-10 10:42:03	ahljoh	Sounds like casting float64 to float32 might do something similar ;)
2019-12-10 10:42:17	ahljoh	I domt need pretty, just correct ;)
2019-12-10 10:42:39	ahljoh	Would be great of I could supply a soft Cmp function, but then i will need non-builtin map
2019-12-10 10:42:42	lemmi	what is even the correct thing to do?
2019-12-10 10:43:10	ahljoh	Soft compare function using epsilon, which is similar to rounding but not necessarily identical ;)
2019-12-10 10:43:27	lemmi	what if the map is populated with very dense keys and the you do a look up. what's the correct entry?
2019-12-10 10:44:34	ahljoh	I guess hashmap with float makes no sense
2019-12-10 10:44:42	guido_g	ack
2019-12-10 10:44:45	guido_g	use a tree
2019-12-10 10:45:30	ahljoh	In my case map would work, but I dont like buidling fundamentally wrong abstractions ;)

2019-12-10 10:47:59	guido_g	if you can define buckets (slots where some keys might reside after rounding) then you might want to use hashing
2019-12-10 10:48:17	guido_g	depends on the range of values too, I think
2019-12-10 10:48:53	guido_g	if every key * 10 does fit in a int64 you're done :)
2019-12-10 10:49:42	ahljoh	Yes, thank you very much
2019-12-10 10:50:20	ahljoh	Problem with buckets is that it quantizes at boundaries, so not useful for a continuous value instead of discrete/ categorical

2019-12-10 14:28:34	jarlopez	I'm working on an HTTP application. Each incoming request is handled by a middleware that injects a request ID into the request's context. I'd like to be able to trace a request through the application logs, and it seems that I have to update every function to take in a context.Context in order to inject the reqID into the log statement.
2019-12-10 14:28:44	jarlopez	Does anyone have other suggested approaches for supporting this?

2019-12-10 14:31:15	jarlopez	Another idea is to provide something like a `type AppContext struct { reqID string; ctx context.Context; /* ... */ }` to more explicitly include expected fields.

2019-12-11 10:37:51	fweht	think i got it now, thanks!  still it seems weird to me that `append` may or may not duplicate the underlying array...  why not updating the pointers in the slices?  is this performance related?  or are the legitimate use cases where one dosnt want the pointers to be updated?

2019-12-11 12:05:39	pandaadb	Hello. I am a bit confused with return values and errors. I wonder if my return value always needs to be a pointer so i can return Nil instead of an empty value, or does it not matter that the zero-value is returned with the error?
2019-12-11 12:06:25	KirkMcDonald	pandaadb: It is typically fine to return whatever the zero value is along with the error.
2019-12-11 12:06:29	pandaadb	in particular with structs I sometimes find myself in a situation where i don't want to return a pointer because i don't want to have my values modified, but then want to return Nil when I run into an error

2019-12-11 12:31:54	guido_g	but youn can achieve that yourself w/ build tags

2019-12-11 12:44:07	elichai2	k
2019-12-11 12:44:43	elichai2	another question, how weird is `func (key *MyThing) Add(tweak [32]byte) error` and the error is optional? or should the api look different?
2019-12-11 12:46:39	guido_g	by returning an error you say "here something can go wrong, watch out"
2019-12-11 12:46:44	sztanpet	what does it mean that the error is optional?
2019-12-11 12:47:39	sztanpet	yes, nil errors signal there was no error, no it doesnt make sense to return an error if there cannot be an error
2019-12-11 12:47:56	iivvoo	aren't they always optional? :) "This method always errors..."
2019-12-11 12:48:08	sztanpet	yea, not sure
2019-12-11 12:49:47	elichai2	it means the addition has failed
2019-12-11 12:50:03	elichai2	I want to edit the variable in place but also signal if the addition has failed
2019-12-11 12:50:58	elichai2	let's say it's an addition that doesn't allow overflowing. so if there will be an overflow I want to return an error and not change the object
2019-12-11 12:51:52	sztanpet	no, an error is clear what it means
2019-12-11 12:52:09	elichai2	even though that if there's no error then there's no return value?
2019-12-11 12:52:20	sztanpet	there is no optional return value
2019-12-11 12:52:27	sztanpet	you return nil if there was no error
2019-12-11 12:52:35	sztanpet	a nil error signals there was no error
2019-12-11 12:53:05	sztanpet	(but there can be)
2019-12-11 12:54:27	sztanpet	elichai2 maybe this will explain it better https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go

2019-12-11 12:56:53	elichai2	I get that. it's just that usually you return `(obj *Object, err error)` and then one will be nil and the other not. but here i'm returning only an `error` without "another option". anyway I just wanted to know if that's idiomatic

2019-12-11 12:58:45	sztanpet	the idiomatic thing is not the exact detail of how many return values there are, but that the last return value is an error if there can be an error

2019-12-11 16:23:36	siXy	minicom: without spending a bunch of time investigating how that 3rd party lib works, it's a little hard to say, because your packet needs more things than you specify there, such as a checksum. I don't know how much of that your lib provides. Suggest you use tcpdump to compare your packet to a syn packet sent by an app that works correctly (nc perhaps?)

2019-12-11 16:37:25	pandaadb	Hi! Coming from Java, i have a bit of a headache in where to put model structs. I am used to having a model package but read that is not the go-way. I have 3 struct types, 1 is for the database storage, 1 for the input read from anywhere, and 1 is used by both those structs. It looks similar to this: https://pastebin.com/6UePdyMj

2019-12-11 16:37:56	pandaadb	I wonder where to put the "BoundingBox" struct. Should that be in storage, and then be reference from input, or rather the other way around, or should it just stay in model? Or is that just completely backwards to beign with

2019-12-12 09:46:09	erikh	ok, well sqlboiler will read your online database schema and generate go code to wrok with it

2019-12-12 09:51:15	erikh	https://github.com/facebookincubator/ent
2019-12-12 09:51:28	erikh	remember, ent will not adapt to an existing schema; but sqlboiler will
2019-12-12 09:51:35	erikh	sqlboiler is quite good at doing that
2019-12-12 09:52:01	aLeSD	I don't see the option to parse a schema file
2019-12-12 09:52:11	erikh	it connects and reads your db
2019-12-12 09:52:22	erikh	you migrate your database into shape, and then point sqlboiler at it
2019-12-12 09:53:02	aLeSD	yes. It seems a bit ugly to run it each time I compile my code
2019-12-12 09:53:22	aLeSD	I think I will be forced to generate the code one and commit it
2019-12-12 09:53:24	erikh	go generate is typically a separate, manually triggered step
2019-12-12 09:53:30	erikh	it doesn't happen at compile time
2019-12-12 09:53:32	aLeSD	I see.
2019-12-12 09:53:51	aLeSD	nice. Thanks: I have a lot to study now
2019-12-12 09:53:54	erikh	it'd be more for your build tooling, and I keep a CI task that generates it and checks
2019-12-12 09:53:58	erikh	yeah, hope it helps. ttyl.

2019-12-12 13:32:29	KirkMcDonald	This alone makes me pretty nervous to use gob, since it's really easy for a deployment of a new version in a production environment to involve communication back-and-forth between an old version of something and the new.
2019-12-12 13:33:12	KirkMcDonald	The possibility of having both forward and backward compatibility is *really* nice to have in a serialization format; it's what protobuf does quite well.

2019-12-12 13:35:34	lluad	I would be surprised if gob made a non-backwards-compatible change that wasn't opt-in / a major version bump.
2019-12-12 13:36:26	KirkMcDonald	Perhaps. But I'll still prefer the library which provides explicit guarantees on the matter.
2019-12-12 13:37:08	KirkMcDonald	As opposed to the one which is fairly clear about *not* guaranteeing that.
2019-12-12 13:37:37	lluad	protobuf doesn't really, at least it didn't between proto2 and proto3. It's part of their philosophy rather than a contract.
2019-12-12 13:38:14	lluad	Which is good enough for me, though.
2019-12-12 13:38:16	KirkMcDonald	The upgrade from proto2 to 3 was extremely explicit, and required conscious opting-in on the part of the developer.
2019-12-12 13:39:22	KirkMcDonald	Though I think the broader issue in this area is the fact proto uses a schema... But maybe that's a whole other conversation.
2019-12-12 13:39:54	lluad	Yeah. It's one of my favorite things about it, though most people seem to hate it. :)

2019-12-12 14:12:30	gerep	I have created a code that is using `syscall.Kill(processNumber, syscall.SIGTERM)`. This process starts a lot of goroutines and it has a graceful shutdown. When the SIGTERM signal is sent, the process does not stop, I thought it was related to the graceful shutdown but it never killed the process even when there was no goroutines running. Any ideas of what I may be doing wrong?
2019-12-12 14:12:44	gerep	That process is managed by systemctl.
2019-12-12 14:13:02	gerep	Using the same systemctl service in my machine, it works as expected =(\
2019-12-12 14:14:08	gerep	I cannot use SIGTERM.
2019-12-12 14:14:20	gerep	I need to wait for the sub processes to finish.
2019-12-12 14:14:45	siXy	gerep: Is this intended to exit this application, or to signal to another application that it should close?
2019-12-12 14:15:22	gerep	siXy, to kill the application and systemctl will notice it was stopped and will start it again.
2019-12-12 14:15:53	siXy	if you are just trying to close your application, os.Exit() would seem more reasonable.
2019-12-12 14:17:02	gerep	siXy, but will it wait for the goroutines to finish what they are doing?
2019-12-12 14:17:19	gerep	I mean, os.Exit() will send a sigterm or sigkill?
2019-12-12 14:17:57	gerep	"The program terminates immediately; deferred functions are not run."
2019-12-12 14:17:58	siXy	well, your previous example won't do that either. If you want to tell your goroutines to shut down cleanly, you'd need to tell them to exit in your code. context.Cancel() or a shutdown channel would be the normal ways of doing this.

2019-12-13 10:20:41	aLeSD	I think I am wrong
2019-12-13 10:21:24	aLeSD	I am thinking in using JSON vectors of different classes ... but I think it is not possiblr in JSON
2019-12-13 10:21:43	aLeSD	so I need one vector per class ... in that case the type of class is defined
2019-12-13 10:21:49	sztanpet	whats a json vector? array? what are its different classes?

2019-12-13 10:25:00	sztanpet	sure
2019-12-13 10:25:10	aLeSD	but , in my understanding it is not valid JSON: JSON array are of only one JSON obejct type
2019-12-13 10:25:38	sztanpet	no, json arrays can hold any type json supports
2019-12-13 10:25:59	sztanpet	your trouble will be with deserializing them in type-safe languages
2019-12-13 10:26:12	aLeSD	yes, that's my prob
2019-12-13 10:26:44	sztanpet	aLeSD have a look see: https://eagain.net/articles/go-dynamic-json/ https://eagain.net/articles/go-json-kind/
2019-12-13 10:26:52	aLeSD	so my best idea is to create several JSON arrays based on the JSON object type
2019-12-13 10:28:42	sztanpet	as you can see after reading the blog post, you can keep your single json you will just have an extra field describing the type and some extra manual code to handle it
2019-12-13 10:29:28	aLeSD	sztanpet, what's the more elegant solution? I am who decide how the JSON file will be structured.
2019-12-13 10:30:28	aLeSD	I prefear the multy array solution
2019-12-13 10:30:36	aLeSD	it seems cleaner
2019-12-13 10:30:41	sztanpet	yes, that sounds pragmatic
2019-12-13 10:30:53	sztanpet	especially if yo uare in control of the json structure
2019-12-13 10:31:03	aLeSD	ok .thanks

2019-12-13 14:43:14	velco	what it's done

2019-12-13 14:47:23	velco	that's one option, yes, close and later create a new one (there's no "reopen")

2019-12-16 10:17:47	lluad	I'd look at something like zap, to generate structured logs if you're looking for something easy to ingest and fast. If you're more looking for pretty, maybe write your own wrapper function / package around fmt.Printf or the stdlib log package.
2019-12-16 10:19:33	lll7	wow, so no common popular solution?

2019-12-16 12:20:06	bpalmer	typically, at least.
2019-12-16 12:20:34	Xatenev	I guess you are looking for panic/recover
2019-12-16 12:20:57	bpalmer	you can use recover to handle panics that happen in the same goroutine
2019-12-16 12:20:59	Xatenev	it just works in a deferred call iirc tho
2019-12-16 12:21:02	Xatenev	ah
2019-12-16 12:21:04	Xatenev	nvm then :P
2019-12-16 12:21:18	bpalmer	but in a large system, that's a tough thing to guarantee

2019-12-16 12:22:49	bpalmer	enrioog: go doesn't provide that facility itself. That's in part why people don't use panics like exceptions

2019-12-16 12:24:59	enrioog	is there a way to handle it?
2019-12-16 12:25:05	bpalmer	You can work around that by using supervisor processes and so forth to help isolate processes.
2019-12-16 12:25:22	bpalmer	So that, as an example, when one process dies, it will be restarted.

2019-12-16 12:30:55	ezdiy	definitely panic() for asserting internal invariants
2019-12-16 12:31:27	bkq	enrioog unless linters can check when you're accessing data in a nil map or something like that
2019-12-16 12:31:45	BeerLover	I don't understand the purpose of done chan bool in this : https://play.golang.org/p/ZiZtcvuMV_F. LINE= 87
2019-12-16 12:32:19	BeerLover	Why is it in select? That case never runs.
2019-12-16 12:32:55	GinjaNinja32	generally I only use panic() where either I'm not sure what the error handling should be yet (in which case I replace it before committing, once I know what it should be), or in test assertions where the error is caused by bad test code rather than bad tested code
2019-12-16 12:35:37	bpalmer	BeerLover: it provides a way for the caller of PrepareItems to make sure the work stops.
2019-12-16 12:35:56	bpalmer	BeerLover: in this case, it doesn't matter: done is closed only when main exits, which will kill all the helper goroutines in any case.

2019-12-16 12:38:28	bkq	enrioog i think the compiler catches division by zero errors
2019-12-16 12:38:36	BeerLover	in this example, done has no effect? What can i change in this example to use done so that the <-done case fires?
2019-12-16 12:38:56	BeerLover	I tried close(done) at various places.
2019-12-16 12:39:04	BeerLover	didn't fire that case.
2019-12-16 12:39:23	enrioog	for example a:=b/c; c may be 0

2019-12-16 12:52:25	bpalmer	enrioog: and to answer your question: if you're writing a system where you need to handle panics, no, you don't need to do it in every function; just in every goroutine
2019-12-16 12:53:12	bpalmer	if F1 calls F2 calls F3 which panics all in the same goroutine, then a deferred recovery in F1 can recover from a panic in F3
2019-12-16 12:53:34	enrioog	as a user can spawn go routine , if he/she forgets to handle
2019-12-16 12:54:31	bpalmer	yes. and if you use third party libraries or even the standard library, you would have to think about that. a linter that warns on use of 'go ' might help.

2019-12-16 15:01:45	mrig	Do you have any preferences or advice on grouping logging events; I am wondering if it would be best to use just a few loggers or to differentiate early and have lots of them, essentially for the different prefix that this would afford?
2019-12-16 15:02:15	mrig	Obviously quite subjective, just wondering what the pros and cons might be?

2019-12-16 15:57:34	echosystm	well, i don't find go to be a very good language for really big complicated systems personally
2019-12-16 15:57:48	echosystm	the type system just isn't very robust compared to languages like swift and kotlin

2019-12-16 15:58:50	echosystm	thats just language side of things though. when you start talking about frameworks thats a whole other thing.
2019-12-16 15:59:11	echosystm	go has a really strong hold on the whole devops and microservices world. more than any other language by far.
2019-12-16 15:59:27	echosystm	not as strong as ruby, php or js on the web dev front though
2019-12-16 15:59:29	echosystm	etc.
2019-12-16 15:59:56	bkq	the main reason i use go is because of deployments being a cinch
2019-12-16 16:00:13	bkq	don't have to worry about sitting through installing npm or composer dependencies on a prod server when i have a statically linked binary
2019-12-16 16:00:36	enrioog	the main reason using golang bcuz of simplicity and concurrency
2019-12-16 16:00:56	bkq	for me it's the static compilation, therefore i know what i've built on my dev machine will contain w/e i put on prod
2019-12-16 16:00:58	Antioch	simple in what respects?
2019-12-16 16:01:00	enrioog	we use dep

2019-12-16 16:02:18	echosystm	this confuses me a lot. when you send sigint to a process, does it not exit?

2019-12-16 16:02:49	bkq	echosystm i'd say Go is good for big complex systems, it just comes down to how you architect your solution
2019-12-16 16:02:57	bkq	i'd say k8s is a good example of a large Go codebase

2019-12-18 11:41:52	[jasper]	so adding items to the queue should check on existance .....a map would be best for that...but map isn't sorted
2019-12-18 11:43:34	sztanpet	search godoc for sorted sets
2019-12-18 11:44:07	sztanpet	look at the source, decide if it seems reasonable enough and use it :)

2019-12-18 11:46:05	sztanpet	depending on your usecase, even a slice and a loop to check uniqueness might be enough too
