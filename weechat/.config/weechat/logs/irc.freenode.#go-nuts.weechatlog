2019-07-02 10:26:21	dominikh	think of methods in Go as fancy methods, with the receiver just being another argument. and an argument called "self" would be weird, wouldn't it. in fact, one would think that "self" inside a function refers to the function, as that's where we are, in a function
2019-07-02 10:26:21	upb	shadowchaser: yeah
2019-07-02 10:26:38	shadowchaser	well, then it makes sense
2019-07-02 10:26:52	dominikh	*as fancy functions
2019-07-02 10:27:35	upb	ah i see, so the dinstinction on which argument the method was invoked shouldn't be made
2019-07-02 10:28:10	dominikh	on top of that, the location of the definition of a method isn't tied to the type's location. it can be anywhere in the file, or in any file in the package. it's not lexically scoped to the type declaration
2019-07-02 10:28:26	upb	that much i've figured out already :)

2019-07-02 10:53:09	upb	oh wow "The Go compiler was single pass until we allowed use before declaration."
2019-07-02 10:54:32	dominikh	of course nowadays the compiler is very far from a single pass; it has an intermediary IR (SSA) and all that modern fun.

2019-07-02 12:54:22	dupondje	The following should work no: https://pastebin.com/raw/FPKm3cEs ?
2019-07-02 12:54:59	siXy	dupondje: Avoid using interface{}.
2019-07-02 12:55:23	siXy	https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/ will give you a properly typed struct representing your JSON.
2019-07-02 12:56:16	dupondje	siXy: I know interface{} is suboptimal, but the content might be variable (and is futher in the code just flattened)
2019-07-02 12:56:36	shadowchaser	dupondje: flattened doesn't matter
2019-07-02 12:57:02	dupondje	also, that site gives indeed a struct representing the JSON, but seems like it has no way to use variable amount of shards :)
2019-07-02 12:57:06	siXy	I don't think the elasticsearch json output is dynamic, actually.
2019-07-02 12:57:20	dupondje	cause the json now has 2 shards (0 and 1), but another might have 5 for example
2019-07-02 12:57:43	dupondje	siXy: not within a version no, but between versions it is :)
2019-07-02 12:57:55	shadowchaser	siXy: great tool, cheers!

2019-07-02 12:58:46	siXy	I am unconvinced that the ES API changes so massively between versions you can't accurately represent it.

2019-07-02 12:59:44	dupondje	well but even then :) Shards    map[string]*shardStruct `json:"shards"`
2019-07-02 12:59:47	dupondje	should be fine?
2019-07-02 12:59:59	rindvieh	dupondje: also remember that you can have json.RawMessage
2019-07-02 13:00:28	siXy	probably map[string]ShardStruct - there's no reason for a pointer in there.  Also your type should be exported.

2019-07-02 13:01:52	dominikh	it doesn't care whether the type is exported or not; it only cares whether the fields in the struct are exported.

2019-07-03 13:22:24	pandaadb	Hi - i have a best practice/design question. I am trying to design an interface for my service that retrieves some data (list of strings). I read about channels and thought it'd be super cool to have a function that takes a channel and sends results there as it processes rather than collect all stuff and return a list. Q1: Do you always have to call functions that write to a channel in a go subroutine? Q2: Is it bad design to have a service interface
2019-07-03 13:22:24	pandaadb	that must be called in a subroutine?
2019-07-03 13:22:41	pandaadb	my pseudo interface would look something like that: https://pastebin.com/90u9tt60

2019-07-03 13:23:28	pandaadb	this might be me coming from java. I.e. i would expect that if a service uses a channel, you would kind of hide the concurrency as an implementation detail of the service, rather than define a service that implies to run in a goroutine

2019-07-03 13:24:12	pandaadb	however at the same time, the pseude interface can use the async method `foo1` to fulfill `foo2` and then you get both. I realise this is a bit open eneded but never having seen production code in go I am stumbling over a few design issues

2019-07-03 15:21:33	siXy	Numline1: Go always passes everything by value.  If you're trying to avoid having multiple copies of a struct you should use a pointer, but I'm very confused by the way you stated your question.
2019-07-03 15:22:01	siXy	"copying a struct into memory" doesn't make a lot of sense to me - a struct is fundamentally a memory structure, so it is in memory _somewhere_.
2019-07-03 15:22:38	Numline1	siXy I may have phrased that poorly. Afaik structs assigned to variables are always assigned as a pointer, never as a real value
2019-07-03 15:22:46	<--	tendencydriven (~tendencyd@94.126.212.172) has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2019-07-03 15:22:46	Numline1	Which honestly probably answers my question
2019-07-03 15:23:17	siXy	Numline1: That's not true.
2019-07-03 15:23:43	Numline1	Having something like cache.Set("somekey", myStruct) will pass the pointer to the struct, without having to write it down as &myStruct
2019-07-03 15:23:57	Numline1	siXy why's that?
2019-07-03 15:23:57	siXy	No, it won't
2019-07-03 15:24:38	siXy	Because that's not how go works.  If you want myvar to be *struct you have to write myvar := &struct{} not myvar := struct{}
2019-07-03 15:25:01	siXy	You may be thinking of slices which are ~ fat pointers under the hood.
2019-07-03 15:25:06	siXy	structs are not that.
2019-07-03 15:26:09	Numline1	oh okay, gotcha, I may have understood that poorly
2019-07-03 15:26:11	Numline1	thanks siXy
2019-07-03 15:27:33	dominikh	the only automatic pointerification that happens is if you have a method with a pointer receiver. calling such a method on a non-pointer is syntactic sugar for first taking the address. i.e. this works: https://play.golang.org/p/8c8ZDGi88r5 – but that is not specific to structs.

2019-07-03 15:52:51	jarlopez	If I have a "readonly" function that inspects some values of a struct and returns a boolean, how do I determine if the signature should be `func (thing *Thing) IsInSomeState() bool` or `func (thing Thing) ...`? The struct contains a few dozen fields, which made me initially lean towards `*Thing`

2019-07-03 15:54:14	dominikh	if it's large enough that copying costs too much, or if other methods are already pointers, use a pointer, and promise not to accidentally write to fields
2019-07-03 15:55:15	jarlopez	dominikh: And the only way to determine if it "costs too much" is to benchmark?
2019-07-03 15:55:52	dominikh	benchmark or educated guess. benchmark won't say much if the method only gets called once in real code
2019-07-03 15:56:11	dominikh	but with "a few dozen fields" you won't have to benchmark; copying that struct will have a cost.

2019-07-03 16:17:08	jarlopez	I've got a set of functions that I'm realizing should be extended to be able to use a provided context. Are there guidelines on naming conventions/argument order for this? Does `func (s *Service) DoTheThing(arg string)` become `func (s *Service) DoTheThingWithContext(ctx context.Context, arg string)`?
2019-07-03 16:17:48	dominikh	context goes first, and ctx is the usual name for the arg. so you got it right.

2019-07-03 17:40:05	jarlopez	I've got a use-case for clients of an HTTP server to be able to ask for mocked-up data (rather than performing the "real" processing and retrieving). My current approach is to specify HTTP headers that clients can set, and populate a context.Context with the values if they're present. The service can then inspect the request context and determine if it should mock-up data or "do the real thing."
2019-07-03 17:40:44	jarlopez	It seems a bit improper to control how the service logic should behave using the key-value store in a Context. Are there alternatives to my current approach? Is it recommended (or not?)

2019-07-03 17:42:20	siXy	Then I'd have a startup flag to control this behaviour.
2019-07-03 17:42:40	siXy	e.g. -disable-mutations
2019-07-03 17:42:50	siXy	or w/e makes sense for your usecase
2019-07-03 17:43:16	jarlopez	The behavior is meant to be request-driven so that the client can ask for a request to always fail/always succeed/randomize behavior with a provided seed
2019-07-03 17:43:37	jarlopez	Similar to how Stripe's API allows clients to use predefined card #s for certain types of card rejections

2019-07-03 17:45:25	siXy	Then I'd control it with a header, but avoid using context to convey this, and instead use some other solution (passing a header map, calling a different sub-function, etc)

2019-07-03 17:48:38	siXy	Yeah.  The context package explicitly discourages you from putting arbitrary parameters in there.  I personally avoid touching the context in any way - I just pass the context from the request as I recieve it.
2019-07-03 17:50:07	jarlopez	Thanks for the pointers

2019-07-04 16:17:51	mkbloke	I'm on Debian stable using go-1.11, trying to compile dnscrypt-proxy from github master.  dnscrypt-proxy uses cloudflare/crypt which now uses the Add64 function.  This seems to have appeared in go-1.12 and on.  Is there an easy way to use bits.go from 1.12 on my 1.11 installation, i.e. a local package override?  I've tried putting a bits.go from 1.12 in $GOPATH/src/math/bits/, but that doesn't seem help.

2019-07-05 11:36:07	iio7	I was thinking that since it's possible to test the code with examples, and there isn't anything you can do with a test that you cannot do with an example, one might as well get into the habit of using examples only. Not only does the code gets tested, but the documentation gets written as well. Rather than perhaps the documentations might be lacking with pure tests.
2019-07-05 11:38:05	sztanpet	for small projects with few tests maybe, even then most tests are useless for documentation purposes and would only condition people to ignore it all
2019-07-05 11:38:36	guido_g	most real world tests are quite complex and do serve well as examples
2019-07-05 11:39:10	iio7	Hmm, another problem is discussed here: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26971
2019-07-05 11:39:13	guido_g	not to mention white-box tests, which have/need access to package internals
2019-07-05 11:39:37	guido_g	so examples as tests are not worth the hassle

2019-07-08 10:52:31	dostoyevsky	skarlso: so instead of doing 1m dot products on one cpu, you'd do like 100k dot products on 10 CPUs in parallel (if you have 10cpus locally available)

2019-07-08 10:55:44	skarlso	what I'm saying is that you don't need a library for that math and if you don't need a library, you can probably do it in parallel if you divi up the vector and give it to a distributed cluster of computing workers.

2019-07-08 11:53:22	upb	sztanpet: yeah i get that
2019-07-08 11:53:43	upb	but what causes the goroutine to return on cancellation?

2019-07-08 11:55:00	someone235	Cadey, sync.RWMutex doesn't guarantee the desired priority
2019-07-08 11:55:03	upb	so the check is implemented inside of http.DefaultClient.Do ?

2019-07-08 11:55:28	sztanpet	of course, its implemented wherever there is a context involved like in your own code too
2019-07-08 11:56:02	upb	okay thx
2019-07-08 11:56:25	upb	so presumably this code linked by guido_g is invoked by Do()
2019-07-08 11:56:52	sztanpet	if you want to handle cancelation, you can do it two different ways, whatever is more appropriate: select{} and ctx.Done() or simply checking ctx.Err()
2019-07-08 11:57:29	upb	but isnt the comment on top the code misleading then?
2019-07-08 11:57:46	upb	'The httpDo function [...] cancels the request if ctx.Done is closed'

2019-07-08 11:58:11	sztanpet	how is it misleading?
2019-07-08 11:58:34	upb	because the httpDo function does not cancel the request or the goroutine
2019-07-08 11:58:43	sztanpet	how come?
2019-07-08 11:58:45	upb	the Do method figures out the context is cancelled and returns
2019-07-08 11:59:20	sztanpet	ah, you mean semantically it doesnt "ABORT EVERYTHING RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT"

2019-07-08 11:59:34	upb	what i gather from your explanation and the code is that the only difference between that example and

2019-07-08 11:59:48	<--	indistylo (~aruns_@106.51.25.10) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2019-07-08 12:00:04	upb	is that the example causes ctx.Err() to be returned instead of whatever f would return in the cancellation case

2019-07-08 12:00:53	sztanpet	sure, there should be contexts all the way down, so that whatever .Do called can exit right than and there too
2019-07-08 12:01:02	upb	yeah i see
2019-07-08 12:02:00	sztanpet	its simply a way to signal that you want to cancel the operation, if something doesnt listen you wont get as effective of a cancelation
2019-07-08 12:02:13	upb	yup, makes sense
2019-07-08 12:02:26	sztanpet	it will still look basically the same to the code, but there will be extra work done, yea
2019-07-08 12:03:11	upb	i was going by the comment and trying to figure out where the magic is that would cause the goroutine to get cancelled :)
2019-07-08 12:03:50	sztanpet	yea, just look at the source, go as against magic mostly

2019-07-08 12:49:27	skarlso	for example, you could have a queue of writers waiting to write and another channel which would signal reads to wake up on sync.Cond being the writer queue is empty.
2019-07-08 12:49:30	skarlso	How does that sound?
2019-07-08 12:49:53	skarlso	you could call c.Broadcast once the queue is len < 1
2019-07-08 12:50:24	skarlso	which would wake readers up. the same condition could be used to make the reads c.Wait() if a new writer is in the queue
2019-07-08 12:51:59	someone235	I'll check sync.Cond. Thanks

2019-07-08 13:31:13	Numline1	Hey guys, I've notice Google apparently publishes two sets of libraries for most of their stuff
2019-07-08 13:31:20	Numline1	https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/api and https://godoc.org/cloud.google.com/go
2019-07-08 13:31:42	Numline1	I understand one's for generic API and one's for their cloud services, but there are dozens which overlap. Is one of them possibly deprecated or something?

2019-07-08 13:41:35	Numline1	lavalike oh gotcha, thanks :) I've noticed the latter library (cloud), which I've been using for Storage, doesn't have YouTube API (since it seems limited to cloud services). However, it should be safe to use the autogenerated one, right?

2019-07-09 14:51:55	Numline1	Cadey their youtubeanalytics/v2
2019-07-09 14:52:11	Numline1	youtube lib itself had some examples, I can't figure out how this one works
2019-07-09 14:52:30	Cadey	Numline1: so at a high level what are you trying to do?
2019-07-09 14:52:46	siXy	Looks perfectly reasonably documented to me.
2019-07-09 14:53:12	siXy	There's a long explanation of what each thing does.
2019-07-09 14:55:10	Numline1	Cadey well I'm trying to pull some basic stats for channels. I'm not sure whether I can do that for 3rd party channels (I'm using server-side implementation, no oauth, no UI). I managed to pull some stuff using their online playground, but I can't figure out which methods do that.
2019-07-09 14:55:15	Numline1	Let me share some code samples
2019-07-09 14:55:32	Numline1	siXy where exactly? The GoDoc is there, but as I said, it's messy
2019-07-09 14:56:21	Numline1	This is what I've been working with so far, please ignore the parts that are commented out - https://privatebin.net/?5e26a9a9627bcfd7#+nvFyKgpGcm04JPz7Lc1f5bj/0K9qumG4Av+fpfGZlQ=
2019-07-09 14:56:33	siXy	The godoc page tells you exactly what each field does, and how to build your query.

2019-07-09 15:04:04	Numline1	siXy okay, I'll try to go through that again. It seems fairly straight forward for non-complex use case such as mine, so I hope I'll find the answers there

2019-07-09 17:50:21	GinjaNinja32	it works for 10 or higher because that way you hit `sum < 1000` being false and stop the loop, before you get to `i > 10` and loop forever
2019-07-09 17:50:25	GinjaNinja32	it should probably be `i < 10` ;)

2019-07-10 13:20:24	siXy	Right, which is why I was somewhat sceptical that this was really needed.   I guess if you need to work flawlessly on old and unsupported windows versions?

2019-07-10 13:56:24	mrig	was wondering what a <link rel='stylesheet' href ...> points at if it is in a template.
2019-07-10 13:57:04	sztanpet	it points at whatever you tell it to point at, its just a url that you handle like anything else
2019-07-10 13:57:20	mrig	so that I get a good feel for how I build structure, I thing that as shadowchaser mentioned is what I am looking for,

2019-07-10 13:58:44	mrig	shadowchaser I have been trying this, but it was not working, thanks for confirming I shall persist with this.
2019-07-10 14:01:39	sztanpet	look at its source to see what it does and how it failed to do what you expected it to do, maybe you need StripPrefix in there too

2019-07-10 22:56:19	jrozner	I'm trying to track down fd leaks in a Go service that I inherited. Using lsof I'm noticing an increasing number of FIFO pipes that stick around after a specific request is made. I don't see any clear unclosed channels. What other Go types would generate pipes on linux?

2019-07-11 10:14:34	XwZ	I don't understang your point, from my kernel point of view, my process has allocated 1G of my RAM and never released it, the virtual memory is way higher but I don't mind
2019-07-11 10:15:58	XwZ	and my docker rules doesn't care about it, if it has a limit of 200Mb, it will kill my docker as it requires to much resources
2019-07-11 10:16:35	sztanpet	okay, lets try from another angle, io.Copy uses sendfile to tell the os to simply pipe from one fd to another fd in kernel space, that means userspace has no view of the data
2019-07-11 10:16:45	sztanpet	if it can of course, its an optimization
2019-07-11 10:17:46	sztanpet	now, think about it, does your go server need to access the data? of course, it sniffs the mime type, it has to handle ranges, etc
2019-07-11 10:18:09	sztanpet	does that mean it all gets buffered in ram? not necessarily, but it does have to be read in userspace and copied to kernel space
2019-07-11 10:19:23	sztanpet	what happens with files if you read them, not entirely buffering it in ram but streaming them out as you can?

2019-07-11 10:47:58	sztanpet	XwZ i would look at CopyN and how it differs from purely calling Copy and how you get to the branch that allocates the slice
2019-07-11 10:50:48	XwZ	sadly, I was using ServeContent to avoid that, but I will investigate
2019-07-11 10:51:58	sztanpet	i meant read the implementation of those
2019-07-11 10:52:12	sztanpet	easily reachable from the docs and all
2019-07-11 10:54:52	XwZ	I've already been into the code of ServeContent, that's why I ended here
2019-07-11 10:55:35	sztanpet	and io.CopyN vs io.Copy?

2019-07-11 11:03:41	sztanpet	the point is that using CopyN will mean that Copy wont be able to optimize it like it could do when calling it with the original reader (since LimitedReader is not a WriterTo
2019-07-11 11:04:16	sztanpet	and it doesnt look like the fallback path will ever allocate more than 32*1024 bytes for the slice

2019-07-12 11:16:54	Xatenev	how do you guys manage your deps? im very new to go
2019-07-12 11:17:10	Xatenev	but it seems to be a bit weird - e.g. I have 3 different projects but all my deps should be in one global go workspace?
2019-07-12 11:17:34	Xatenev	e.g. python uses `venv` to get around that, is that an option for go? what do you guys do?
2019-07-12 11:18:37	Xatenev	I also found go-dep but "dep was the "official experiment." The Go toolchain, as of 1.11, has adopted an approach that sharply diverges from dep. As a result, we are continuing development of dep, but gearing work primarily towards the development of an alternative prototype for versioning behavior in the toolchain."

2019-07-12 11:19:56	rindvieh	Xatenev: since go 1.11 you can use go modules
2019-07-12 11:20:08	Xatenev	yes but where are those go modules stored
2019-07-12 11:20:13	Xatenev	arent they in gopath / go work space
2019-07-12 11:20:24	sztanpet	read the documentation
2019-07-12 11:20:58	sztanpet	not sure why it matters right from the start where go modules are
2019-07-12 11:21:11	rindvieh	Xatenev: in practice it's not really important where the modules are stored
2019-07-12 11:21:14	sztanpet	you want to manage dependencies, so just start with the quick start
2019-07-12 11:21:16	Xatenev	rindvieh, why?
2019-07-12 11:21:35	Xatenev	sztanpet, because I don't want my project to be a mess right from the start? Oo
2019-07-12 11:21:54	sztanpet	why would it be a mess if you know nothing about modules?
2019-07-12 11:22:09	sztanpet	you are coming with some hefty presuppositions to this discussion
2019-07-12 11:22:18	Xatenev	sztanpet, in the link you posted I don't see where it says how to use the modules
2019-07-12 11:22:26	Xatenev	sztanpet, it only says how I would make my own module which is not relevant for me
2019-07-12 11:22:31	Xatenev	(to my current question atleast)
2019-07-12 11:23:10	sztanpet	https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-to-use-modules

2019-07-12 11:23:32	Xatenev	yes
2019-07-12 11:23:40	sztanpet	maybe you think modules are independent of dependency management?
2019-07-12 11:23:42	Xatenev	that talks about how to make my own module
2019-07-12 11:23:46	rindvieh	Xatenev: the compiler just uses the module cache path
2019-07-12 11:23:53	sztanpet	just please read
2019-07-12 11:23:57	Xatenev	I did read
2019-07-12 11:24:10	rindvieh	Xatenev: no need to check in the dependencies
2019-07-12 11:24:38	Xatenev	sztanpet, is your point that my application should have a go.mod too?
2019-07-12 11:24:41	Xatenev	and not just modules?
2019-07-12 11:24:56	Xatenev	rindvieh, yes but imagine you have project A B and C right
2019-07-12 11:25:04	sztanpet	of course, if you have read anything on the link it would be obvious
2019-07-12 11:25:09	Xatenev	ok
2019-07-12 11:25:15	Xatenev	Ive read 50% of it
2019-07-12 11:25:17	Xatenev	and its not obvious at all
2019-07-12 11:26:16	rindvieh	Xatenev: then in each project you would `go mod init mysvnservice.tld/project`
2019-07-12 11:26:19	Xatenev	the go book talks about two types of go applications: libs and applications, your link talks about modules but never define it any further
2019-07-12 11:26:23	sztanpet	its a place to gather information though, most of the minutiae is linked from there

2019-07-12 11:27:58	Xatenev	i think the current version of go would be cool in the /topic
2019-07-12 11:28:01	Xatenev	btw
2019-07-12 11:28:02	Xatenev	:P

2019-07-12 14:50:03	upb	but doesn't that mean the source code will contain references to the packages git repo?

2019-07-12 15:09:40	narcos	Hi all. I'm using Gorilla Mux in my webserver, and am passing URLs as a parameter - e.g http://localhost:8080/u/somesite.com . This works fine unless the passed URL has a ? in it, and that gets eaten. If I print out r.URL the ? is present, but mux.Vars(r)["url"] truncates from the question mark.
2019-07-12 15:09:49	narcos	I've tried r.SkipClean(true) to no avail
2019-07-12 15:09:54	narcos	any tips?

2019-07-12 15:13:46	narcos	It is of type url.URL

2019-07-12 15:14:32	sztanpet	its still a misunderstanding about how urls work though, you are providing a url as the path in a url
2019-07-12 15:15:03	sztanpet	query parameters are part of the url, not part of the path
2019-07-12 15:15:52	sztanpet	aka "this will never work" either pass the url as a parameter itself, properly escaping it on the way

2019-07-15 11:09:38	krasi-georgiev	actually they are identical.
2019-07-15 11:09:39	krasi-georgiev	I was trying to use 	`github.com/prometheus/prometheus v2.11.1` and `go mod tidy` kept reverting it to `github.com/prometheus/prometheus v0.0.0-20190710134608-e5b22494857d`  but `e5b22494857d`  is the latest commit of the `v2.11.1` tag.
2019-07-15 11:09:47	krasi-georgiev	so I am still a bit confused os of why it does that.

2019-07-15 11:12:28	krasi-georgiev	sztanpet: I get the version selectoin logic, but in this case the tagged version is the same commit id. Also running go mod graph shows that no other package requires this untagged version.
2019-07-15 11:12:46	sztanpet	krasi-georgiev how are you requiring the new version?
2019-07-15 11:13:00	kai	Is there any way to make a map immutable? I've got a web service where I need to map some strings coming in via JSON to some actual types in my code
2019-07-15 11:13:16	sztanpet	nothing built into the language kai
2019-07-15 11:13:34	krasi-georgiev	tried `go get github.com/prometheus/prometheus@v2.11.1` and also manually editing the do.mod files
2019-07-15 11:13:40	krasi-georgiev	file*
2019-07-15 11:14:10	sztanpet	and your import statements have v2 in them and everything right
2019-07-15 11:15:07	sztanpet	https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/go.mod doesnt have v2 in its import path either
2019-07-15 11:16:21	sztanpet	anyway, maybe prometheus should read https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-to-prepare-for-a-release
2019-07-15 11:16:25	krasi-georgiev	why is this required if I manualy specify in the go.mod file that I want to use `github.com/prometheus/prometheus@v2.11.1`
2019-07-15 11:16:34	kai	sztanpet: ok, thanks. practically I doubt anybody reasonable would futz with those maps, but in general I like to make sure :)
2019-07-15 11:17:07	kai	but it's probably not worth the effort if there's nothing in the language/stdlib
2019-07-15 11:17:23	sztanpet	krasi-georgiev because its the only way to make automatic library updates easy for the user
2019-07-15 11:17:32	krasi-georgiev	I mean in the `avalanche` tool's go.mod file I manually specify that I want to use ` github.com/prometheus/prometheus@v2.11.1`
2019-07-15 11:17:33	krasi-georgiev	here is the output of `go mod graph` https://pastebin.com/CAg1B5Pm
2019-07-15 11:17:45	sztanpet	krasi-georgiev read the blog posts on https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#new-concepts if you are interested
2019-07-15 11:18:51	sztanpet	kai alternatives are usually not exposing the map, but only methods where you can take care of locking properly

2019-07-15 11:20:21	sztanpet	krasi-georgiev tried go mod why?
2019-07-15 11:20:38	krasi-georgiev	yes, but let me try again.
2019-07-15 11:20:43	guido_g	this go.mod versioning thingy is not really usable if you're not following the google way of things
2019-07-15 11:21:29	sztanpet	its different and everybody has different expectations on how it should work, yea
2019-07-15 11:21:33	guido_g	and that you need to change every single import for a v2 is just stup...
2019-07-15 11:21:55	guido_g	that's why something more open would have been better
2019-07-15 11:21:59	sztanpet	how is it stupid?
2019-07-15 11:22:04	sztanpet	its a different library
2019-07-15 11:22:20	guido_g	just force everyone to do it like google wants it sucks
2019-07-15 11:22:30	sztanpet	looks like you didnt understand the problems either
2019-07-15 11:22:34	guido_g	sure
2019-07-15 11:22:41	guido_g	I know this kind of argument
2019-07-15 11:22:55	krasi-georgiev	I am quite happy with the modules 🙂

2019-07-15 15:22:24	Xatenev	yea i dont think theres a general naming convention for that, a lot of terms float around for that
2019-07-15 15:22:28	matti	jarlopez: Sometimes, when I am not sure, I look through GitHub to see what is the most popular one (by the number of hits). Probably a silly thing to do.
2019-07-15 15:22:39	Xatenev	copy() isnt too uncommin either :P
2019-07-15 15:22:44	Xatenev	uncommon
2019-07-15 15:23:02	matti	:)
2019-07-15 15:23:31	jarlopez	Apparently I can also do the following: `theClone := TheStruct(prevStruct)`
2019-07-15 15:23:38	matti	I think, if you document it explaining in the comment that it's intended to return a copy of current object (which is really a new object with some fields copied/changed) then it would be fine?
2019-07-15 15:23:57	matti	jarlopez: Naming things is hard, also... :)
2019-07-15 15:24:05	Xatenev	jarlopez, yes you can do that
2019-07-15 15:24:17	Xatenev	jarlopez, fwiw this even works with different structs if they have the same structure

2019-07-15 15:25:23	jarlopez	It's an interesting feature. I wonder if perhaps it's more explicit to wrap that logic with `func (thing *TheStruct) Copy() *TheStruct { return &TheStruct(thing) }`

2019-07-15 16:27:20	siXy	You're asking bash to truncate your file to zero, then call goimports with STDOUT redirected to that file.  goimports sees a blank file and prints nothing, so you're left with nothing.
2019-07-15 16:27:37	siXy	I strongly advise not asking bash to do this.

2019-07-15 16:29:16	siXy	This is how bash has worked for many decades, and will continue to do so.  It fundamentally has to work this way - nothing else would make sense.

2019-07-15 16:48:23	marlinc	Okay lets say were to make github.com/marlinc/lib, would you say I'd also include the protobufs in that or rather make a github.com/marlinc/protobufs and then generate a github.com/marlinc/lib from that?
2019-07-15 16:48:58	siXy	I would suggest including the proto alongside the generated code in a single lib that you then import.
2019-07-15 16:49:11	sztanpet	whats the point of a separate protobufs repo? what do you gain by it

2019-07-15 16:49:36	siXy	If your buildsystem is good enough to automatically run go generate when you compile your app, then there's no need for that and you can just include the proto.
2019-07-15 16:49:46	jrwren	committing generated code is a VERY old tradition. even 20-25yrs ago, code generated by lex/yacc was often kept around, committed instead of regenerated
2019-07-15 16:50:28	siXy	jrwren: Just because it's old doesn't make it automatically a good idea.  strcpy is old, too.
2019-07-15 16:50:41	edrocks	much better to version control the generated code imho
2019-07-15 16:50:42	marlinc	I'm probably also gonna be generating PHP libraries from the protobufs, and in the PHP world its normal to have a repository in which you have a src directory that contains the library code

2019-07-15 16:51:13	marlinc	If I'd have one repo with protobufs, Go library code and PHP, wouldn't that make a mess?

2019-07-15 16:59:09	siXy	marlinc: protobuf is a totally reasonable standard, there's nothing wrong with your approach.
2019-07-15 16:59:21	jrwren	edrocks: again, a lot like SOAP in that regard too :)  especially depending on which tools you use to make the server.
2019-07-15 16:59:51	siXy	marlinc: How to structure and separate all this out is really more dependent on your buildsystem than anything, but a reasonable default would I think be what I described above, with a the proto files in the root of the lib, and per-language subdirs.
2019-07-15 16:59:59	edrocks	jrwren luckily I've never had to make a SOAP server just several dozen clients
2019-07-15 17:00:04	saml	so, is it good to have protobuf repo that go, python, php... apps use to generate code?

2019-07-15 17:00:39	marlinc	siXy, well the thing is, I come from a background using tons REST and slowly coming to the conclusion that a RPC like system is more scalable (for internal stuff)
2019-07-15 17:00:56	edrocks	saml I don't see any issue besides syncing all of those repos. Any reason you can't stick into one repo if it's all official clients? I'd consider the tradeoffs
2019-07-15 17:00:57	marlinc	siXy, because of the strictly defined contract
2019-07-15 17:01:03	siXy	Yes, I strongly agree.
2019-07-15 17:02:53	siXy	marlinc: Are you intending to use gRPC, or just plain protos?
2019-07-15 17:03:01	saml	me too. protobufs are web scale cause they are much faster than jsons. such performance numbers
2019-07-15 17:03:56	siXy	saml: I think you should consider stopping trying to talk about what you consider "web scale".
2019-07-15 17:04:29	siXy	This is not the best channel for that :)
2019-07-15 17:04:46	saml	web scale means it's good. so, as a conclusion, a separate repo for protobuf + all clients. and go app lives in its own repo
2019-07-15 17:06:25	marlinc	siXy, gRPC at the moment, but that's since I didn't really know the two could be used as separate things
2019-07-15 17:06:40	saml	you can make an app that generates and publishes all clients for different languages from pushed protobuf
2019-07-15 17:06:56	siXy	marlinc: You don't actually _need_ to use gRPC, but you definitely should if you have the opportunity.

2019-07-16 15:12:11	Xatenev	i think you just need a lock() unlock() around the println call

2019-07-16 15:15:27	siXy	Xatenev: No, locking and unlocking the mutext for the println command will do exactly nothing - there is only one main goroutine, and println itself is not the racey part.
2019-07-16 15:15:40	Xatenev	siXy, it worked for me
2019-07-16 15:16:30	siXy	Xatenev: It will work sometimes, yes.  That is the nature of data races - your code works some of the time.

2019-07-16 16:59:31	Nilium	sauyon: https://play.golang.org/p/lcnTbcSGyfl
2019-07-16 16:59:35	Xatenev	defer should put it at the end, no
2019-07-16 16:59:36	Xatenev	?
2019-07-16 17:00:06	Xatenev	so it becomes file, err := os.Open(fileName) if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) } file.Close()
2019-07-16 17:00:14	sauyon	oh, I'm being silly.
2019-07-16 17:00:19	Nilium	Xatenev: Your defer needs to happen after the error check.
2019-07-16 17:00:24	Numline1	Xatenev it doesn't "put it at the end" in a sense you see in the code (if I'm correct)
2019-07-16 17:00:25	siXy	Xatenev: Have you read https://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover ?
2019-07-16 17:00:25	Nilium	It can't happen before.
2019-07-16 17:00:30	siXy	If not, read it ;)
2019-07-16 17:00:31	Numline1	it executes at the end of the function
2019-07-16 17:00:54	Numline1	if that function gets that far. There are several articles explaining how this works :)
2019-07-16 17:00:57	Nilium	Or rather, it can happen before, if you want to panic when err != nil.

2019-07-16 17:01:24	Nilium	Just think about the order of things.
2019-07-16 17:01:39	sauyon	hrm, is it selection of members that panics on nil values?
2019-07-16 17:02:47	Nilium	No.
2019-07-16 17:02:58	Nilium	Dereferencing nil is what panics.
2019-07-16 17:03:22	Xatenev	it doesn't really answer my question
2019-07-16 17:03:22	sauyon	right, and member access does that implicitly
2019-07-16 17:03:30	Xatenev	as to why file.Close() would panick if its deferred to the end
2019-07-16 17:03:38	sauyon	I was being silly, see above
2019-07-16 17:03:46	Nilium	sauyon: It does, but it's the thing before member access that counts there.
2019-07-16 17:03:57	Xatenev	:\
2019-07-16 17:04:27	Nilium	Xatenev: Do you think the deferred call won't happen if you return an error?
2019-07-16 17:04:35	sauyon	that makes sense, yeah
2019-07-16 17:04:46	Xatenev	Nilium, o i see what youre saying

2019-07-16 17:47:52	sztanpet	https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules
2019-07-16 17:48:37	sztanpet	there are also blog posts about it on blog.golang.org, and further info under the links in the new concepts section of the wiki
2019-07-16 17:48:55	Xatenev	seems to be a common problem... had the exact same issue when i came in this channel days ago heh
2019-07-16 17:49:08	Xatenev	but sztanpet to the rescue :)
2019-07-16 17:49:23	sztanpet	yea, not sure what people are doing to miss those
2019-07-16 17:49:51	sztanpet	i guess its not the number one thing on google when people search for it?
2019-07-16 17:49:59	Xatenev	well in my case I just picked one book from the golang books
2019-07-16 17:50:10	sztanpet	ah, so many "bad" books
2019-07-16 17:50:22	Xatenev	well not necessarily bad, probably just older than the module system
2019-07-16 17:51:07	Xatenev	sztanpet, I used http://www.golang-book.com/books/intro
2019-07-16 17:51:22	Xatenev	It has 11. Packages but the chapter is really basic and doesn't really talk about go.mod etc yet

2019-07-23 13:39:12	mrig	Are there any reasons that the use of a iframe might not be a good idea to display a table from a database when constructing a server?
2019-07-23 13:40:13	sztanpet	mrig not sure how the choice of html elements has anything to do with servers
2019-07-23 13:40:40	mrig	Seems at the moment that it could be a nice simple html http solution to containing a result set within a page.
2019-07-23 13:41:03	sztanpet	StucKman sounds like a server, in which case you have to know the port you want to listen on? or is this about client requests to a server, in which case the solution by siXy sounds about right

2019-07-23 13:43:52	sztanpet	mrig "displaying a table" is best done by using tables i would think, but maybe your usecase demands it somehow
2019-07-23 13:44:19	mrig	it just seems to logically go with the form tool set.

2019-07-23 13:49:09	StucKman	let it scroll with the page?
2019-07-23 13:50:07	mrig	on a form?
2019-07-23 13:50:50	mrig	I think people tend to use JS at the moment for this sort of thing.
2019-07-23 13:51:14	StucKman	mrig: you mean a <FORM>?
2019-07-23 13:51:20	mrig	yes

2019-07-23 13:51:34	StucKman	how would you use a <FORM> and an <IFRAME>?
2019-07-23 13:51:49	mrig	an in frame inside a form is the thought.
2019-07-23 13:52:30	mrig	say for when you have multiple telephone numbers or contact means.
2019-07-23 13:52:31	StucKman	but then the fields in the IFRAME will not be part of your FORM, you have to have another FORM inside the IFRAME's page
2019-07-23 13:53:13	StucKman	you want to have dynamic fields? then use JS and probably jquery
2019-07-23 13:53:17	mrig	All that they need to do is to be a list, display data.

2019-07-23 14:38:15	siXy	StucKman: Perhaps if you stepped back a bit and told us more about what you're really trying to do we could help you more effectively.
2019-07-23 14:38:25	StucKman	or that I think in terms of another language's semantic
2019-07-23 14:38:44	StucKman	I already did that, but ok
2019-07-23 14:38:52	StucKman	(like 1h ago)
2019-07-23 14:39:05	mrig	lempa Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
2019-07-23 14:39:06	siXy	Trying to write Go as if it was another language is also bad design ;)
2019-07-23 14:39:19	siXy	StucKman: Sorry, I missed that - can you repeat it
2019-07-23 14:39:22	mrig	go is awesome.
2019-07-23 14:40:03	StucKman	I'm writing a web installer for a web service. both need to use the port 80, so the installer has at some point to switch from 80 to another port. hence, I nedd to listen to two ports, have the same behaviour in both, except for one single route
2019-07-23 14:40:33	StucKman	siXy: yes, is bad in any lang2lang, but I can't wrap my head around golang yet, sorry
2019-07-23 14:41:04	StucKman	I'm so used to the promiscuity of Python that these restrictions look heavy
2019-07-23 14:41:50	sztanpet	break out the mux init into a functian that acceps a mux argument and call it twice
2019-07-23 14:42:01	sztanpet	heavy if you think about it the wrong way
2019-07-23 14:42:07	StucKman	sztanpet: yeah, doing right that now

2019-07-23 14:42:24	mrig	StucKman the wiki on the word multiplexer has helped me to understand mux.
2019-07-23 14:42:41	mrig	was a mystery until I decoded the acronym.
2019-07-23 14:43:08	 *	mrig stares disdainfully at all the acronyms.
2019-07-23 14:43:10	siXy	Yep, +1 to sztanpet's solution.  Though I think if I were writing this I'd probably do it differently and have the service I was installing initially listen only on localhost, and proxy requests to it
2019-07-23 14:44:28	sztanpet	easier to test too
2019-07-23 14:44:59	StucKman	no, because once the installer is finished, I can't run any code to make the service listen on all ports

2019-07-23 14:50:11	mrig	lempa awesome those frames support the tab index too.
2019-07-23 14:50:27	siXy	Thinking about it more, I'd probably do it _completely_ differently and configure nginx to run in front of both, passing certain routes to the installer until it's done its job.  Then you don't need to mess around with ports ever - nginx always handles recieving the traffic (plus TLS), and passes it back to your application.
2019-07-23 14:50:49	siXy	Then all you need is some pretty trivial nginx configuration and everything's a lot easier.
2019-07-23 14:50:54	mrig	StucKman my response was intended for you though :) Just thought that doubling a mux was kinda counter intuitive to what a multiplexer is and does.
2019-07-23 14:51:28	StucKman	siXy: Im not adding nginx to this soup

2019-07-23 14:53:22	lempa	if both ports has same

2019-07-23 15:07:05	Numline1	Hey folks. I'm using go-redis to save some http responses (as a caching mechanism). For some reason, Redis seems to strip the top level of the JSON (it's still there after I call json.Marshal()) - https://privatebin.net/?0e57d3bc67d071e1#8juU8pgsNzV4KAbMsMDj5PipoJAizYRDxdLDqFrV6RLe
2019-07-23 15:07:11	Numline1	Any thoughts on why this might be happening?
2019-07-23 15:07:44	Numline1	To tl;dr the issue, I have {"post": {...}}. Redis only saves the inner {...} part and completly removes the top level key
2019-07-23 15:08:12	siXy	Numline1: Have you considered just sticking varnish in front of your application instead of trying to do this yourself?
2019-07-23 15:08:46	Numline1	siXy sure, however I also cache several other things + the caching is very conditional depending on the request values
2019-07-23 15:08:56	Numline1	conditional in a way only the app can recognize
2019-07-23 15:10:08	lempa	and redis lib is... ?

2019-07-23 16:19:04	dominikh	go fmt is a specific wrapper around gofmt, that nobody uses.
2019-07-23 16:19:16	sztanpet	yea, that would explain it
2019-07-23 16:19:23	howell	dominikh: right, but that makes it do things that goimports doesn't right?
2019-07-23 16:19:27	dominikh	go fmt is gofmt -l -w, on a list of files specified via a package. whereas gofmt is the underlying tool, running on individual files
2019-07-23 16:19:46	dominikh	considering goimports dropped the -s flag, yes.
2019-07-23 16:20:00	dominikh	but you can goimports + gofmt -s, if you wish to also run -s

2019-07-23 17:28:15	siXy	mrig: If you want others to help you for free, you need to spend less time on what your needs and what you believe you're entitled to, and have a bit more empathy with those that would help.  Note that on IRC you're essentially anonymous - if you feel you're being treated worse than others it's almost certainly been bought on by your behaviour - we have nothing else to go on.

2019-07-23 17:29:44	dominikh	Tv`: I guess he didn't appreciate your less formal, witty way of writing, after all.
2019-07-23 17:29:49	Tv`	i would argue this channel has a lot of empathy for "i have trouble with this specific thing" and nothing but disdain for "please solve this for me as i refuse to read every sentence of the relevant document"

2019-07-23 17:30:58	Tv`	godzirra: well, with modules you don't need GOPATH/src anymore
2019-07-23 17:31:00	siXy	godzirra: I've always done this in the past by doing a git clone to the right part of my gopath, then after that go get -u will DTRT
2019-07-23 17:31:05	mrig	I must say it seems a little snooty in here.
2019-07-23 17:31:10	dominikh	godzirra: if you're using GOPATH, use the GOPATH (i.e. place the package in there). if you're using Go modules, you can probably use a replace directive to point anywhere on the local file system.
2019-07-23 17:31:33	godzirra	I'm using go modules.  I didn't know there was such a thing as r eplace directives.  Let me google.

2019-07-23 17:31:56	Tv`	godzirra: the real answer for bigger companies, multiple developers, etc is probably going to be modules nad running a local GOPROXY that can access private things
2019-07-23 17:32:05	godzirra	Tv`: I was afraid of that.
2019-07-23 17:32:13	mrig	guido_g I have no work and am trying to do something about it.
2019-07-23 17:32:36	Tv`	godzirra: you can get pretty far with just having your private repos accessible to your local "go get", e.g. via configuring git right
2019-07-23 17:32:47	godzirra	But that requires ssh keys, right?
2019-07-23 17:32:53	Tv`	godzirra: that or http auth
2019-07-23 17:32:55	godzirra	Which means I need ssh keys for my build servers.

2019-07-23 17:33:50	Tv`	mrig: here's a tip: on the average, people aren't gonna care about your "phenotype", or needs.
2019-07-23 17:33:55	Xatenev	mrig, is that what happens when you are focussing on your own weaknesses too much?
2019-07-23 17:33:56	Xatenev	just curious
2019-07-23 17:34:07	Tv`	mrig: also, please talk about Go
2019-07-23 17:34:16	Tv`	mrig: because that's what the rest of us are here for
2019-07-23 17:34:21	siXy	I'd argue that if you want your git repos to _stay_ private, and aren't using ssh keys, you're probably doing it wrong :)
2019-07-23 17:34:39	Tv`	siXy: with the git authentication helper stuff, http auth is realistic
2019-07-23 17:34:52	dominikh	siXy: I think their issue lies with having keys _on the builder/CI box_ specifically.
2019-07-23 17:34:58	godzirra	^^
2019-07-23 17:35:02	mrig	Xatenev is what what happens?
2019-07-23 17:35:03	Tv`	it's more of a "here are your building blocks" than ssh, but it's doable
2019-07-23 17:35:05	dominikh	but of course they need _some_ way of getting the code on there, anyway
2019-07-23 17:35:14	mrig	Xatenev these are strengths tool
2019-07-23 17:35:16	mrig	too
2019-07-23 17:35:19	dominikh	which boils down to a) rely on github b) rely on internal infrastructure
2019-07-23 17:35:20	siXy	Tv`: Ah, I'd read that he wasn't doing either but actually one of those lines was you.  I should expand my font size...
2019-07-23 17:35:20	Tv`	godzirra: you could use github's "deploy keys" thing
2019-07-23 17:35:56	sztanpet	mrig managed to find the correct format string to parse your date at least?
2019-07-23 17:36:01	Tv`	godzirra: then the only thing the ssh private key enables is cloning the repo
2019-07-23 17:36:48	godzirra	Hm, that may work
2019-07-23 17:36:49	dominikh	(there's also /vendor/ of course, but I can't argue that each module vendoring its private dependencies is a good solution)
2019-07-23 17:37:13	Tv`	dominikh: i wish there was a good tool for "extract *these* deps from my local cache into a dir"
2019-07-23 17:37:16	dominikh	also I think it forces you do vendor every dep, not vendor selectively

2019-07-23 17:37:52	edrocks	the app projects vendor everything. Libs don't
2019-07-23 17:37:53	dominikh	Tv`: that seems buildable
2019-07-23 17:38:02	Tv`	as in, `go mod download && export-deps blargh/ && upload-to-cloud blargh/`
2019-07-23 17:38:04	Tv`	dominikh: yes
2019-07-23 17:38:23	Tv`	then your CI would just use the cloud copy of blargh as GOCACHE
2019-07-23 17:38:26	dominikh	maybe, when I start using modules in ~2-3 years, I'll build it for you ;)

2019-07-23 17:38:46	mrig	Tv` I just asked how to escape the 0 in a date format for time.Parse, that seems quite go'ish to me?

2019-07-23 17:39:41	mrig	yes I have done in the past.
2019-07-23 17:39:43	sztanpet	mrig the example i linked you has the solution to your problem, you just have to read the latter part of the example
2019-07-23 17:39:51	mrig	not this time around.
2019-07-23 17:40:01	mrig	sztanpet: oh I did not see the link,
2019-07-23 17:40:12	siXy	marlinc: Not only that, but it has (IMO) a very sensible approach towards doing it, to avoid hosing the backend server.  If this is something you depend on, consider reading https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/connection-backoff.md
2019-07-23 17:40:21	edrocks	since when is github like paetreon?

2019-07-23 17:41:56	mrig	Tv` the section on time.Parse
2019-07-23 17:42:00	marlinc	Cool thank you siXy, will read that
2019-07-23 17:42:01	edrocks	Has anyone tried to abuse this yet? "GitHub will match all contributions up to $5,000 during a developer’s first year in GitHub Sponsors."
2019-07-23 17:42:10	Tv`	09:39 <Tv`> mrig: did you read the beginning of golang.org/pkg/time ?
2019-07-23 17:42:32	dominikh	edrocks: well, they did say that they have systems in place to detect abuse. so at least they're aware of the possibility
2019-07-23 17:42:41	dominikh	how well they can do that in practice I do not know
2019-07-23 17:42:43	Tv`	mrig: also, what part in the section about time.Parse
2019-07-23 17:43:10	edrocks	dominikh Oh good, the first that jumped in my mind was what? People will totally ruin that if it's not some set list of projects or something
2019-07-23 17:43:26	dominikh	so far they haven't stopped doing it, so that's good :D
2019-07-23 17:43:36	Tv`	edrocks: i recall it getting on the list was an approval process
2019-07-23 17:43:55	dominikh	oh yes, you do need to apply to be accepted to the sponsor program. though there isn't a ridiculously high bar
2019-07-23 17:44:10	dominikh	I suppose a scammer would already need to have active projects, though.
2019-07-23 17:44:51	mrig	Tv` I have read it several times and have not yet found how to do what I would like to do. So that really is the issue that I have with it, the information that I am clearly lacking, I am apparently not able to find.
2019-07-23 17:44:57	edrocks	seems like a lot of politics to deal with
2019-07-23 17:45:03	siXy	edrocks: I think if you want to commit fraud there are probably easier ways of doing it?
2019-07-23 17:45:14	dominikh	money tends to involve politics
2019-07-23 17:45:55	mrig	I have built and run databases in professional context before, it is not as if I am not tec able or totally stupid.
2019-07-23 17:46:33	mrig	was a visual interface though, not text.
