2019-10-17 11:25:50	yuken	Alright so
2019-10-17 11:25:56	yuken	I legitimately have no clue how _scrolling_ works for GUIs.
2019-10-17 11:26:59	+zebbiz_pi	You use the scroll wheel
2019-10-17 11:27:46	yuken	yes ya dummy but how are they implemented? the only way I can reasonably think of is: render mask + ignore things outside of view
2019-10-17 11:27:58	yuken	and have all child elements be relative to that element
2019-10-17 11:31:34	R2robot	lol
2019-10-17 11:32:34	R2robot	is there no existing gui lib you can use
2019-10-17 11:32:41	R2robot	there must be hundreds
2019-10-17 11:33:51	yuken	R2robot, none that will integrate smoothly with what I'm doing
2019-10-17 11:34:02	yuken	and also I want to write my own.
2019-10-17 11:34:25	R2robot	i suspect the 2nd sentence it the actual answer :P
2019-10-17 11:34:29	yuken	nop
2019-10-17 11:34:32	R2robot	but oh well
2019-10-17 11:34:36	R2robot	nothing new about that
2019-10-17 11:35:13	yuken	Getting any GUI lib to function nicely with Raylib bindings is gonna be a pain in the ass.
2019-10-17 11:36:47	R2robot	even the raylib gui?
2019-10-17 11:37:18	R2robot	https://github.com/raysan5/raygui
2019-10-17 11:37:19	yuken	Unless you wanna write bindings for me
2019-10-17 11:37:34	R2robot	in what?
2019-10-17 11:37:38	yuken	Rust.
2019-10-17 11:37:48	R2robot	blech

2019-10-17 12:28:19	elsie273	so last night i was working on a thing
2019-10-17 12:28:30	elsie273	and i got a load of crashes related to my hashmap
2019-10-17 12:28:39	elsie273	and i was like, oh no, i thought i fixed this
2019-10-17 12:28:58	elsie273	and thought, maybe i just didn't pull the latest version into this project
2019-10-17 12:29:25	elsie273	i copied the version from my local copy of the repo with the hashmap and everything worked
2019-10-17 12:29:50	elsie273	and then i looked again and realised those changes hadn't been committed
2019-10-17 12:30:03	elsie273	and they've just been sitting on my pc since like august
2019-10-17 12:30:43	elsie273	and i just got super lucky to copy from there instead of doing a refresh pull, lucky to have not just deleted/overwritten that file at some point
2019-10-17 12:31:09	elsie273	past me wrote the fixes better than present me would so i probably would have been screwed
2019-10-17 12:46:06	+zebbiz_pi	elsie273: Nice
2019-10-17 12:46:30	+zebbiz_pi	FOrgetting to commit or push is easy
2019-10-17 12:49:40	elsie273	it's not something i would usually forget
2019-10-17 12:50:11	elsie273	on the plus side ecs systems going over multiple components in a way i like is nearly done
2019-10-17 12:50:31	elsie273	i decided to ditch efficiency for now and just make the interface how i want it

2019-10-17 13:50:03	elsie273	Jonas wuu2?
2019-10-17 14:08:34	yuken	idk if I can manage to write an entire GUI library, I might just have to use C so I can use Raygui.,
2019-10-17 14:35:10	elsie273	yuken imgui?
2019-10-17 14:35:33	yuken	elsie273, wat
2019-10-17 14:35:50	yuken	I'm using Raylib, which has an official GUI library.
2019-10-17 14:36:28	elsie273	yuken one of the most popular gui libraries: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
2019-10-17 14:36:34	yuken	I know that
2019-10-17 14:37:17	elsie273	"i might just have to use c"
2019-10-17 14:37:27	elsie273	what does you mean?
2019-10-17 14:37:38	yuken	Either I have to switch to C(++), or I have to write bindings, elsie273
2019-10-17 14:37:51	elsie273	oh
2019-10-17 14:37:56	+zebbiz_pi	elsie273: yuken is currently working in Rust
2019-10-17 14:38:06	elsie273	oh
2019-10-17 14:38:12	yuken	So those are the 3 options, I'm tryying to figure out which is best.
2019-10-17 14:38:14	elsie273	lots of things have rust bindings
2019-10-17 14:38:19	elsie273	doesn't imgui?
2019-10-17 14:38:27	yuken	No clue, probably?
2019-10-17 14:39:41	elsie273	at least four different attempts: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Bindings
2019-10-17 14:41:38	yuken	Getting any of that to work well with Raylib is gonna be a pain in the ass, elsie273
2019-10-17 14:45:02	elsie273	it shouldn't be so bad
2019-10-17 14:45:31	elsie273	the point of imgui is that you just pass it your gl context and it works
2019-10-17 14:45:49	+zebbiz_pi	yuken: Considering you want to do most of the work yourself, everything will be a pita :P
2019-10-17 14:47:04	yuken	elsie273, 1/4 of those bindings seem to do that o-o
2019-10-17 14:47:17	yuken	1/3*
2019-10-17 14:48:27	elsie273	sounds like you just want to complain. do the work or use gamemaker
2019-10-17 14:48:58	R2robot	yuken: are you the guy that was working on fog of war?
2019-10-17 14:49:18	yuken	elsie273, well I have no clue how to do a lot of what I'm tryna do here, like scrolling containers
2019-10-17 14:50:22	 *	R2robot still thinks you should start with something MUCH smaller and simpler
2019-10-17 14:50:31	R2robot	even 2d
2019-10-17 15:10:07	+carefish	i still think that yuken should just get started with whatever he wants to make
2019-10-17 15:10:17	+carefish	rather than doubt a 'found path' and not deciding to pick anything :p
2019-10-17 15:10:34	yuken	That's what I'm doing carefish, I'm trying to figure out how scrolling stuff works in GUI stuff. and trying to get a cursor up for text stuff.
2019-10-17 15:13:11	+carefish	why not work on your game first
2019-10-17 15:13:20	+carefish	ui stuff can be added while working on the game
2019-10-17 15:13:52	yuken	Because getting the GUI to work is probably the most important part of the game.
2019-10-17 15:14:06	yuken	it's first and foremost a MUD, with the text-based roleplaying that comes with a MUD.
2019-10-17 15:16:28	+carefish	hmmkay
2019-10-17 15:17:16	yuken	Right now, I'm just trying to get text input (copy, pasting, cursor, selection) and scrollable containers (with text wrapping too).
2019-10-17 15:17:28	yuken	and scrolling is what I don't get.
2019-10-17 15:18:28	+carefish	scrolling like scrollbar or scrolling like scrolling text
2019-10-17 15:19:19	yuken	The former. So I could have a big text box that lets you scroll through (because players may be submitting/saving large bodies of text for various reasons)
2019-10-17 15:19:29	yuken	or scrolling through different GUI stuff, like... a list of players.
2019-10-17 15:19:55	+Jonas___	elsie273, I'm jealous of you making progress on ECS
2019-10-17 15:20:08	+Jonas___	it's been years since I worked on mine
2019-10-17 15:20:20	+carefish	so scrollbar requires you to set up a clipping mask yuken
2019-10-17 15:20:31	+carefish	and a contentmask
2019-10-17 15:20:34	+Jonas___	instead I'm now worrying about how to do event driven microservices for real-time high availability web services
2019-10-17 15:20:41	+Jonas___	it's not really ECS at all :|
2019-10-17 15:20:48	+carefish	the content mask is the thing that goes up and down, the clipping mask stays in-place
2019-10-17 15:20:48	yuken	carefish, I can setup masks (probably), that shouldn't be too hard.
2019-10-17 15:20:55	yuken	oh oh oh
2019-10-17 15:21:09	+carefish	i'm using 'content' because it could be anything with this approach. images and whatnot should work too
2019-10-17 15:21:18	yuken	I can render every container onto a separate texture, and then have that "content" mask just be coordinates on that texture (a rectangle)
2019-10-17 15:21:21	yuken	and scroll like that?
2019-10-17 15:21:26	+carefish	yar
2019-10-17 15:22:00	yuken	thanks carefish, I was trying to figure out how I'd do it, that's all I wanted to know :P
2019-10-17 15:22:00	+carefish	though i wouldn't mess with putting all of it on a single texture
2019-10-17 15:22:09	+carefish	that's overcomplicating what you are aiming to achieve
2019-10-17 15:22:11	yuken	er
2019-10-17 15:22:15	yuken	every container onto its own texture.
2019-10-17 15:22:31	+carefish	so then you have a container with multilpe containers each their own texture
2019-10-17 15:22:51	yuken	hmm
2019-10-17 15:23:03	+carefish	it's "smart" to try and draw everything on one texture... but since you don't have anything working yet just start with whatever you can get to work first
2019-10-17 15:23:39	+carefish	which almost always leads to a suboptimal way of doing things, but at least it will give you a much better vantage point than you have now

2019-10-17 16:16:06	+carefish	ie: instead of going C++ with SDL2, start with unity3d or anyother engine that allows you to be quickly visually reinforced with your learning and progress
2019-10-17 16:16:24	+bomb	like making an open world VR MMORPG for PS5
2019-10-17 16:16:36	+carefish	once you get the feel for what programming is, try to take on harder things... like C++ with SDL2
2019-10-17 16:16:43	yuken	R2robot, I have decent experience, just never released a product.
2019-10-17 16:16:43	R2robot	yeah
2019-10-17 16:16:52	yuken	R2robot, and I'm not trying to make some masterful product, just a simple 2D MUD.
2019-10-17 16:17:05	+carefish	i strongly believe that that's the core strength of those 'simpler' engines (game maker, unity, godot, probably others)
2019-10-17 16:17:08	R2robot	yuken: games are hard. :)
2019-10-17 16:17:15	yuken	well duh, enver said it was easy
2019-10-17 16:17:18	yuken	but I ain't making Half-Life 4.
2019-10-17 16:17:38	+carefish	to help fledgling programmers/hobbyists learn programming/scripting by SHOWING the result rather than working TO the result
2019-10-17 16:17:47	R2robot	I often tell people to make breakout.  You learn all about gamedev from such a simple game. AND you learn how difficult it is to finish a game.
2019-10-17 16:17:59	yuken	I've made Breakout & Snake before. And full games.
2019-10-17 16:18:11	R2robot	links?
2019-10-17 16:18:14	+carefish	i remember being somewhat dissapointed it took me a couple of days to get a simple sprite to render with lazyfoo's tutorials (i didn't know anything about C++ or build systems or whatnot at the time)
2019-10-17 16:18:16	yuken	Just never... released any, and they've all been lost to time because when I made these games
2019-10-17 16:18:19	yuken	I didn't bother to back anything up.
2019-10-17 16:18:31	+carefish	R2robot: i think breakout is still 'complex' though
2019-10-17 16:18:37	+carefish	imo pong is a better start
2019-10-17 16:18:41	R2robot	yeah
2019-10-17 16:18:53	+carefish	pong also gives you a springboard to move to breakout
2019-10-17 16:19:21	R2robot	yep
2019-10-17 16:19:26	R2robot	sound advice :D
2019-10-17 16:19:37	+carefish	and going back to that memory, i also remember it took me 15 minutes to get not only a sprite to show in unity, but i could make it jump and collide with things and not really worry about 'how' that all worked
2019-10-17 16:20:16	+bomb	just give your kids Qbasic64 for extreme productivity
2019-10-17 16:20:36	+carefish	though i started with Flash games, moved to XNA, tried C++ with SDL, found out i couldn't learn opengl due to study stress, had to switch to unity3d to actually make something
2019-10-17 16:20:51	+bomb	you were making Flash games?
2019-10-17 16:21:06	+carefish	i still think XNA, even though it's dead af, is a good starting point for many people which are more 'code oriented'
2019-10-17 16:21:19	+bomb	like, using Flash-the-program, or something like Flixel, FlashPunk, etc.?
2019-10-17 16:21:38	+carefish	it's super unlikely you'll hit performance problems with XNA, and it will be relatively easy to remove/reduce perf eaters
2019-10-17 16:21:43	+carefish	all of it bomb
2019-10-17 16:21:54	+carefish	i used to have the flash editor hooked to flashdevelop
2019-10-17 16:22:04	+carefish	or just a plain flashdevelop project that spat out an swf
2019-10-17 16:22:10	+bomb	also, if you liked XNA, you'd just enjoy MonoGame or FNA as well
2019-10-17 16:22:25	+bomb	HaxeFlixel with Haxedevelop <3
2019-10-17 16:22:40	+carefish	i haven't used FNA/monogame since by then i was already busy with unity3d and some haxe projects
2019-10-17 16:22:54	+carefish	imo haxe is fucking amazing at what it does, it's such a shame people scoff at it
2019-10-17 16:23:08	elsie273	yuken has been in this channel with stuff for a long time
2019-10-17 16:23:19	elsie273	yuken didn't you make a networked 2d platformer?
2019-10-17 16:24:35	+bomb	carefish: Haxe guys are working on a new VM. it's gonna make porting game to all platforms easier
2019-10-17 16:24:42	+carefish	hehe
2019-10-17 16:24:46	+carefish	that's awesome
2019-10-17 16:24:49	yuken	elsie273, I didn't do the networking, that was made in an engine that handled networking for me.
2019-10-17 16:24:54	+bomb	yeah. no hxcpp hackery anymore
2019-10-17 16:25:03	+carefish	i was fine with hxcpp hackery
2019-10-17 16:25:09	+carefish	it worked, and worked performantly
2019-10-17 16:25:39	+carefish	what i really liked, although at the time i didn't have enough knowledge to properly use it.... is to have haxe spit out the source code humanreadable
2019-10-17 16:26:12	+carefish	so you could learn and see how haxe use(d/s?) SDL under the hood to help you do a lot of things)
2019-10-17 16:26:47	yuken	I think the GUI and networking portions of this game are gonna be the hardest parts tbh
2019-10-17 16:27:01	+bomb	carefish: i mean, hxcpp is nice. but when it doesn't work, you're screwed
2019-10-17 16:27:13	+bomb	it was really difficult to debug last time i tried many years ago
2019-10-17 16:27:18	+bomb	during NME days, IIRC
2019-10-17 16:28:33	+carefish	hehe yeah
2019-10-17 16:28:40	+carefish	i remember the split between openfl and nme
2019-10-17 16:29:06	+carefish	still though, haxe is pretty darn cool. it's too bad i don't have an active use for it
2019-10-17 16:29:25	+bomb	because you don't do web games anymore?
2019-10-17 16:29:49	+carefish	nope
2019-10-17 16:32:56	elsie273	yuken but you still made something was my point

2019-10-17 16:33:12	elsie273	it doesn't matter if you wrote the networking
2019-10-17 16:33:38	elsie273	everyone is writing things with tools that do half the everything for them. it's fine
2019-10-17 16:34:56	 *	R2robot has also been in the channel a long time
2019-10-17 16:35:02	R2robot	lurking -_-
2019-10-17 16:36:44	yuken	elsie273, then yes, although I never finished that one :P
2019-10-17 16:37:00	+carefish	bomb: the thing i would think about using haxe for... is port old flash apps (not games) to a native model, like hxcpp
2019-10-17 16:37:03	R2robot	lol
2019-10-17 16:38:30	+carefish	IIRC one of VMWare's tools is still Flash based
2019-10-17 16:38:39	+carefish	i would most definitely try to port that away from flash

2019-10-17 16:39:40	yuken	carefish, ESXI's web GUI was until recently
2019-10-17 16:39:45	yuken	whhich may be what you're thinking about (it isn't anymore)
2019-10-17 16:40:01	+carefish	you'd think that
2019-10-17 16:40:17	+carefish	i know of several companies still stuck with the flash thing due to licensing/can't easily phase it out/etc
2019-10-17 16:40:29	yuken	das silly
2019-10-17 16:41:10	+carefish	at least one of those companies refuses to use the new thing till it's been out for a while

2019-10-18 09:24:50	+DrAwesomeClaws	has anyone in here who watches anime watched Sound and Fury yet?  Curious as to what those who actually watch this stuff think.
2019-10-18 09:27:37	Syrinxos	Good morning! ^^
2019-10-18 09:36:50	+Jonas___	haven't even heard of it, DrAwesomeClaws
2019-10-18 09:36:56	+Jonas___	morning Syrinxos
2019-10-18 09:37:23	+DrAwesomeClaws	Jonas___, country artist sturgill simpson teamed up with some japanese guys to make an anime for his synth wave disco rock album
2019-10-18 09:37:37	+Jonas___	haha, that explains it
2019-10-18 09:37:42	+DrAwesomeClaws	it's on netflix
2019-10-18 09:37:46	+Jonas___	the official trailer gave me that kind of vibe
2019-10-18 09:38:06	+DrAwesomeClaws	my favorite album of the decade
2019-10-18 09:38:12	+DrAwesomeClaws	possibly century, too early to tell though
2019-10-18 09:38:49	+Jonas___	I'll have to listen to the album
2019-10-18 09:39:31	+DrAwesomeClaws	the anime is just the album as well. No dialog, just music with crazy cartoons

2019-10-18 09:42:54	+Jonas___	perturbator, that's one of the bands it reminded me of
2019-10-18 09:43:11	+Jonas___	though I haven't heard the actual songs so it may be way different
2019-10-18 09:43:23	+DrAwesomeClaws	oh, and hi Syrinxos
2019-10-18 09:43:33	+Jonas___	that and carpenter brut, which seems appropriate for your hobby
2019-10-18 09:44:49	+DrAwesomeClaws	Perturbator is different, but there's certainly some crossover
2019-10-18 09:45:40	+DrAwesomeClaws	sound and fury spotlights the synth as well, with a twangy guitar rock and/or disco background
2019-10-18 09:46:58	+DrAwesomeClaws	Perturbator makes me feel like im in a montage in an 80s movie
2019-10-18 09:47:01	+DrAwesomeClaws	that's not a bad thing
2019-10-18 10:07:23	IkeKrull	show us on the doll where you where peturbated
2019-10-18 10:09:40	+DrAwesomeClaws	so i've been using deezer for music streaming lately
2019-10-18 10:09:43	+DrAwesomeClaws	and it's pretty good
2019-10-18 10:09:50	+DrAwesomeClaws	but im thinking of unsubscribing for one reason

2019-10-18 10:10:18	+DrAwesomeClaws	when you click the album art it doesn't show it larger.  For that you have to click the stupid "..." menu and choose "zoom in on album"
2019-10-18 10:10:30	+Jonas___	an unforgivable sin
2019-10-18 10:10:37	+DrAwesomeClaws	it's fucking rediculous
2019-10-18 10:11:04	+Jonas___	just send their support/feedback an angry message about how stupid it is and how they are bad people for not having fixed it
2019-10-18 10:11:19	+Jonas___	that's what I do when I have to use a service that has a ridiculous restriction
2019-10-18 10:11:29	+DrAwesomeClaws	they'll probably tell me it works if i don't use the shitty unmaintained wine aur package
2019-10-18 10:11:30	+Jonas___	makes me feel better and gives them at least a chance to get feedback on the issue
2019-10-18 10:11:35	+Jonas___	oh
2019-10-18 10:12:08	+DrAwesomeClaws	actually i think it's maintained, haha. But there's a good chance it's somehow my fault
2019-10-18 10:12:09	+DrAwesomeClaws	but still
2019-10-18 10:12:27	+Jonas___	elsie273, a faster valgrind-ish huh?  I remember writing an AI in my game and making it time-stepped just for the purposes of being able to test a "playthrough" in valgrind, as it was way too slow to even play otherwise
2019-10-18 10:12:52	+Jonas___	making the game physics + AI time-stepped, I should say
2019-10-18 10:14:10	+DrAwesomeClaws	i forgot valgrind was a think that exists
2019-10-18 10:14:22	+DrAwesomeClaws	just spent 2 minutes wondering why i knew that word
2019-10-18 10:16:22	+DrAwesomeClaws	i should do the oscp test for fun.  I paid for the labs and stuff long ago then just never took the test because i lose interest after i actually learn something
2019-10-18 10:16:45	+DrAwesomeClaws	but i think that's when i was using valgrind a lot
2019-10-18 10:18:03	+Jonas___	oscp huh, we've got a hacker harry in our midst
2019-10-18 10:18:13	+DrAwesomeClaws	you should refer to me as Mr Robot
2019-10-18 10:18:21	+Jonas___	I'm glad I have my IRC mask on so I don't get superhacked
2019-10-18 10:18:58	IkeKrull	i can see your ip address is 127.0.0.1! i'm hacking you *right now* youre gonna be pwned so hard..
2019-10-18 10:19:10	+Jonas___	looks like an interesting course tho
2019-10-18 10:19:12	+DrAwesomeClaws	shit, i didn't know there was another hacker in here
2019-10-18 10:19:26	+Jonas___	IkeKrull, don't hack that, that's where I keep all my files
2019-10-18 10:20:12	+DrAwesomeClaws	oscp is good shit.  The cert actually requires you be able to do stuff.  No multiple choice bullshit
2019-10-18 10:20:48	+DrAwesomeClaws	test is: they give you a big fake corporate network and you have 24 hours to comprimise it.  Then 24 hours to write a pen test report boring paper
2019-10-18 10:20:54	+Jonas___	yeah, that's what seems appealing, it might actually teach me a thing
2019-10-18 10:21:15	+DrAwesomeClaws	and the labs are simulated networks.  Down to network traffic happening in real time and stuff
2019-10-18 10:21:42	+Jonas___	that's cool
2019-10-18 10:22:08	+Jonas___	do you get to access a similar network for practice, or is it a simulated live scenario that you only get to do once?
2019-10-18 10:22:33	+DrAwesomeClaws	yes, the labs are similar to what you'll see in the main test
2019-10-18 10:22:49	+DrAwesomeClaws	different networks/vulns and stuff
2019-10-18 10:23:06	+DrAwesomeClaws	but each is basically a big, super detailed ctf with many systems
2019-10-18 10:25:36	+Jonas___	sounds like a lot of fun
2019-10-18 10:25:46	+Jonas___	I wish I could say I would have the time to invest in getting to know it
2019-10-18 10:26:20	+Jonas___	then again it would probably not be a very useful skill for me, in a job setting I have other things I'm a lot better at than pentesting
2019-10-18 10:27:36	+DrAwesomeClaws	i'd like to get back into that stuff, but it's also not very relevant for me atm
2019-10-18 10:28:08	+DrAwesomeClaws	though i fear someday i'll be kidnapped by terrorists and won't be able to hack them to save the world if i don't brush up sometime soon
2019-10-18 10:28:36	+Jonas___	you'll have to fall back to building a fusion powered iron man suit to blow them up
2019-10-18 10:28:48	+DrAwesomeClaws	i've been going down a category theory rabbit hole
2019-10-18 10:29:00	+DrAwesomeClaws	that's a good idea
2019-10-18 10:29:20	+DrAwesomeClaws	https://www.youtube.com/user/DrBartosz/videos  this dudes lectures are good
2019-10-18 11:20:14	yuken	Huh. Raylib has a RenderTexture2D, to use as a framebuffer
2019-10-18 11:20:23	yuken	but idk how to actually _use_ it. Unless I'm meant to cast it...
2019-10-18 11:29:11	elsie273	Jonas yup i remember the article, that's why i mentioned it ^-^
2019-10-18 11:29:27	yuken	Huh, it looks like the Rust bindings don't... work with Raylib's RenderTexture stuff...
2019-10-18 11:29:32	elsie273	but it's just nice to have leak detection on windows
2019-10-18 11:30:05	elsie273	i used visual leak detector back in like 2012 but it stopped working at some point and i never replaced it
2019-10-18 11:30:13	elsie273	and it was a pain anyway
2019-10-18 11:34:45	yuken	oh my fucking god, I am at inbred hillbilly levels of stupid
2019-10-18 11:34:50	yuken	raylib-rs has raygui built-in
2019-10-18 11:34:52	yuken	and I didn't notice
2019-10-18 11:43:02	+Jonas___	it's okay, yuken still pretend you knew all along
2019-10-18 11:49:49	yuken	well turns out, whoever wrote these bindings did not test them very well.
2019-10-18 11:49:52	yuken	Text input doesn't work at all.

2019-10-18 12:29:21	+zebbiz_pi	yuken: lol
2019-10-18 12:30:28	+Jonas___	I got more right than I got wrong
2019-10-18 12:30:39	+Jonas___	also from now on I'm naming my projects after pokemans
2019-10-18 12:31:00	Syrinxos	zebbiz_pi: lmao
2019-10-18 12:31:19	yuken	i'm just about to give up on gamedev completely
2019-10-18 12:32:13	+zebbiz_pi	yuken: Now you know enough about it to see how complicated it is
2019-10-18 12:32:26	+zebbiz_pi	Now is the time you can learn the most and should continue
2019-10-18 12:32:49	+zebbiz_pi	It's when you realize how little you know that you can start improving for real
2019-10-18 12:35:16	elsie273	i had a productive evening last night
2019-10-18 12:35:31	elsie273	maybe i'm leeching yuken's life force
2019-10-18 12:36:18	+zebbiz_pi	elsie273: Good
2019-10-18 12:36:29	+zebbiz_pi	Sharing is caring
2019-10-18 12:40:23	yuken	zebbiz_pi, no
2019-10-18 12:40:24	yuken	it isn't complicated.
2019-10-18 12:40:35	yuken	getting the language I want to use working is complicated
2019-10-18 13:01:45	+zebbiz_pi	Jonas___: How many times have you seen Pistvakt?
2019-10-18 13:01:57	+Jonas___	probably 0
2019-10-18 13:01:58	+zebbiz_pi	That's too few, watch it now
2019-10-18 13:02:05	+Jonas___	no thanks
2019-10-18 13:02:15	+zebbiz_pi	You don't know what you're missing
2019-10-18 13:02:34	+carefish	FOMO
2019-10-18 13:03:10	+carefish	yuken: still rust?
2019-10-18 13:03:44	yuken	yes.
2019-10-18 13:03:53	+carefish	IF you're having troubles with rust, it might be a good idea to shift down what you want and make a pong/breakout clone just to focus on getting better at it
2019-10-18 13:03:58	yuken	what?
2019-10-18 13:04:00	yuken	no, Rust itself is great.
2019-10-18 13:04:11	yuken	I want to use libraries like imgui/raygui/etc, because fuck writing my own GUI library seriously
2019-10-18 13:05:24	+carefish	well, why not make the parts of the user interface you need
2019-10-18 13:05:35	+carefish	rather than try and tackle it as a 'omg i need a gui library'
2019-10-18 13:05:44	yuken	I...
2019-10-18 13:05:50	yuken	am only making what I need.
2019-10-18 13:05:58	+carefish	then get on with it you boob
2019-10-18 13:06:12	+carefish	i'm quite sure you can get rust to do your bidding
2019-10-18 13:06:14	yuken	Can't do that without writing bindings to Raylib myself, or using another graphics library.
2019-10-18 13:06:25	yuken	Because the available bindings to Raylib for Rust are broken.
2019-10-18 13:06:39	yuken	And I don't feel like going through some archaic, semi-automatically-generated code to fix it.
2019-10-18 13:07:15	+carefish	well, what about using C/C++ as the main language instead, so you get your nifty gui's and whatnot
2019-10-18 13:07:25	+carefish	but write big chunks of the game itself in rust and do interop?
2019-10-18 13:07:37	yuken	I would rather not make a game, than even come close to a Makefile.
2019-10-18 13:08:03	+carefish	don't give up though
2019-10-18 13:08:07	+carefish	gamedev is hard
2019-10-18 13:08:24	yuken	I just don't get why there is no minimal framework to do what I want
2019-10-18 13:08:29	yuken	without going towards a whole damn engine
2019-10-18 13:09:12	+carefish	well, rust is still relatively new
2019-10-18 13:13:47	elsie273	yuken the trailblazer
2019-10-18 13:38:38	elsie273	Jonas i forgot to mention
2019-10-18 13:38:54	elsie273	i offhandedly mentioned that slack comment to my boss
2019-10-18 13:39:07	elsie273	and the next day saw he'd left a smiley face on it lmao
2019-10-18 13:39:30	elsie273	he is def more passive aggressive than i am
2019-10-18 13:39:49	elsie273	well bc i'm not
2019-10-18 13:43:26	yuken	carefish, ok so it looks like what I'm gonna have to do, is write my own bindings
2019-10-18 13:43:31	yuken	which should'nt be too hard, just... very time consuming
2019-10-18 13:44:27	+carefish	well
2019-10-18 13:44:33	+carefish	only if you want to make a complete binding
2019-10-18 13:44:37	+carefish	if you just bind what you need
2019-10-18 13:44:46	yuken	that's what I'm going to do.
2019-10-18 13:44:54	+carefish	and add more 'as you need them' it doesn't have to take up that much time
2019-10-18 13:44:56	yuken	Just binding the 2D stuff.
2019-10-18 13:45:09	+carefish	good start
2019-10-18 13:45:24	+carefish	if you can, try and show/ask the raylib folks for feedback on the binding
2019-10-18 13:45:58	+carefish	so that maybe when you put those on github/where ever, one of them might expand on it while you're working on your game
2019-10-18 13:45:58	yuken	I'm gonna see if I can fix the existing binding first.
2019-10-18 13:46:04	+carefish	good idea

2019-10-18 14:04:16	yuken	:q
2019-10-18 14:05:06	yuken	and it's also mirroed.
2019-10-18 14:05:16	yuken	so flipped in both directions... what the heck?
2019-10-18 14:07:52	+bomb	yukon i was looking for ya
2019-10-18 14:08:45	yuken	why is this texture flipped o-O
2019-10-18 14:10:55	+bomb	flip normals in blender i don't know
2019-10-18 14:12:03	+bomb	so i want to make a game like
2019-10-18 14:12:11	+bomb	you know, a simulation game
2019-10-18 14:12:22	+bomb	but more like a management simulation
2019-10-18 14:12:36	+bomb	all those Tycoon series, Theme Hospital, Startup Company, etc.
2019-10-18 14:13:24	yuken	Okay yeah, it looks like this texture is being mirrored over the X axis, for some reason. Dunno if it's an issue with the bindings or not, though.
2019-10-18 14:13:39	yuken	https://i.imgur.com/TqDly1G.png
2019-10-18 14:14:03	+bomb	yeah cool
2019-10-18 14:14:24	+bomb	anyway, should i use an RDBMS to make a management game?
2019-10-18 14:14:27	+bomb	that feels so natural

2019-10-18 14:25:39	+carefish	they seem quite handy
2019-10-18 14:26:23	+bomb	the heck is yubikeys
2019-10-18 14:27:57	+carefish	a physical usb key for 2-step auth

2019-10-18 14:29:49	+carefish	i want the convenience the key gives me tho
2019-10-18 14:30:20	+carefish	well, sorta i guess. i haven't looked up how they actually are used yet
2019-10-18 14:30:31	+Jonas___	elsie273, hehe, your boss seems pretty cool
2019-10-18 14:30:38	+carefish	but i imagine it would make logging in to more sensitive stuff easier to access while keeping it secure
2019-10-18 14:30:47	+bomb	btw carefish i think you have a nice opinion on my shit
2019-10-18 14:31:35	+bomb	carefish: i want to make a management sim, and i'm a web turd, so using databases and shit we use in biz apps would be nice. what ya think?
2019-10-18 14:34:43	+carefish	as long as you don't store binary blobs in there you should be fine
2019-10-18 14:38:11	+bomb	why the heck i do that
2019-10-18 14:38:20	+bomb	i'll use the rdbms for game logic
2019-10-18 14:53:43	+bomb	tell me i'm awesome karef
2019-10-18 14:59:33	elsie273	Jonas he is

2019-10-23 10:36:06	+DrAwesomeClaws_	my new pocket knife makes my day about 43% better.
2019-10-23 10:41:22	+zebbiz_pi	Why?
2019-10-23 10:41:36	+zebbiz_pi	People think you have a big dick in your pants?
2019-10-23 10:41:55	+DrAwesomeClaws_	they already know that.  It's just a nice knife is all
2019-10-23 10:43:05	+zebbiz_pi	ok
2019-10-23 10:43:22	+DrAwesomeClaws_	i decided to get it because my other one broke and i get 60% off at Kershaw.  But then i noticed that Amazon had it for about the same price as i could get it for because it's 60% off of the rediculous msrp that nobody actually sells it for
2019-10-23 10:44:31	+DrAwesomeClaws_	https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017KN4MS/  it's pretty nice though.  Holds a edge much better than the shitty steel of my older one

2019-10-23 10:46:15	+DrAwesomeClaws_	i worried about that a bit, but it's good.  It's not really slippery even when kind of wet

2019-10-23 10:46:54	+DrAwesomeClaws_	thought i was going to have to sand/dremel some grip into it
2019-10-23 10:47:15	R2robot	ahh
2019-10-23 10:47:38	+DrAwesomeClaws_	i mean, it's slicker than a plastic one with lots of ridges

2019-10-23 12:38:45	+DrAwesomeClaws_	it's a reasonable price, the D2 steel on the blade is good and the normal stainless on the back of the blade is good.  The normal (non composite) Leek is probably a better deal all around if you don't use a knife often.  It has decent steel, won't hold an edge quite like the D2, but still pretty good
2019-10-23 12:38:51	+DrAwesomeClaws_	and like $40 i think?

2019-10-28 10:33:32	elsie273	later i'm going to reduce the resolution and the look will kinda look like a mix of cell shading and pixel art maybe
2019-10-28 10:33:40	elsie273	or it will suck

2019-10-28 15:23:03	+zebbiz_pi	Also, remove summer time or winter time?
2019-10-28 15:23:26	+Jonas___	I got the impression that winter time will be the permanent time, but maybe I misunderstood
2019-10-28 15:23:34	+Jonas___	elsie273, you're never getting a brexit to be honest
2019-10-28 15:23:44	elsie273	aww you still keep in touch with your family? that's sweet
2019-10-28 15:23:46	+Jonas___	indefinite extensions are your life now

2019-10-28 15:24:04	elsie273	indefinite hate from all angles
2019-10-28 15:24:19	+Jonas___	brexit won't be officially cancelled, but politicians will so many hurdles in place that it can never actually happen

2019-10-28 15:27:23	+Jonas___	zebbiz_pi, you'd think there would be an announcement on govt sites and aftonbladet/expressen/etc, if it were officially announced
2019-10-28 15:27:53	+Jonas___	elsie273, the EU is a symptom, as well
2019-10-28 15:28:09	+Jonas___	the politicians are increasingly detached from the people they are supposedly governing
2019-10-28 15:28:30	+zebbiz_pi	>EU-parlamentet har röstat för att ställa sig bakom en slopad tidsomställning mellan vinter och sommar. Nu har varje land två år på sig att avgöra huruvida man vill behålla vintertid eller sommartid året om.

2019-10-28 15:31:29	+zebbiz_pi	Normal time is the way to go
2019-10-28 15:32:49	+Jonas___	just pick one and let me know once you guys have decided
2019-10-28 15:33:01	+Jonas___	summer vs winter time => I sleep
2019-10-28 15:33:12	+Jonas___	swatch internet time => real shit
2019-10-28 15:33:34	+Jonas___	let's just split the day into 1000 units of time and be done with it
2019-10-28 15:34:04	+Jonas___	24 / 60 / 60 / 1000, this is some "lets measure weight in stones and distance in feet" tier shit
2019-10-28 15:36:31	+zebbiz_pi	tbh, 60 and 24 are nice in the way that they have many divisors
2019-10-28 15:37:34	+zebbiz_pi	60 you can divide with 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 without going into float
2019-10-28 15:38:10	+zebbiz_pi	wait
2019-10-28 15:38:12	+zebbiz_pi	not 5
2019-10-28 15:38:24	+zebbiz_pi	yes, 5
2019-10-28 15:38:25	+Jonas___	yes, 5 too
2019-10-28 15:38:29	+zebbiz_pi	60/5=12
2019-10-28 15:38:33	+zebbiz_pi	See?
2019-10-28 15:38:50	+Jonas___	I'm starting to think that with your math skills, you shouldn't be in charge of picking our time measurement system :(
2019-10-28 15:38:56	deniska	also compound divisors: 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
2019-10-28 15:39:17	deniska	sure we can do better than 60: 360
2019-10-28 15:39:27	deniska	even more divisors \o/
2019-10-28 15:40:16	deniska	the time portion of our datetime handling is still much better than the date portion :)
2019-10-28 15:40:24	+Jonas___	agreed
2019-10-28 15:42:08	+Jonas___	the gregorian calendar could be somewhat improved by keeping the 12 months but going with 30/31 days alternating
2019-10-28 15:42:42	+Jonas___	but that's such a significant change that it doesn't make sense to do for such a minor improvement, it would be better to find a more thorough revamp at that rate
2019-10-28 15:43:05	+zebbiz_pi	Stardate
2019-10-28 15:43:29	+Jonas___	I dunno how stardates work
2019-10-28 15:43:52	+zebbiz_pi	No one does, it's not consistent through out the series
2019-10-28 15:43:59	+zebbiz_pi	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardate
2019-10-28 15:44:15	+Jonas___	so it's just like warp speed and the prime directive then
2019-10-28 15:44:27	+zebbiz_pi	ye
2019-10-28 15:46:07	+zebbiz_pi	>Despite the guideline to "pick any combination", the list of episodes shows stardates increasing with time in general, albeit with many instances of a number being lower than in the preceding episode.

2019-10-29 16:09:23	R2robot	lol
2019-10-29 16:09:58	+zebbiz_pi	So if the average temp in one day is above 0C, then it's not winter

2019-10-29 16:10:31	R2robot	so if the weather warms up a bit, it's no longer winter?

2019-10-30 10:53:57	+Jonas___	you'll have to take a vacation and come visit or something

2019-10-30 10:54:33	+Jonas___	I have the most american milling machine for you right here: https://ghostgunner.net/product/ghost-gunner-3-deposit/
2019-10-30 10:54:57	elsie273	a holiday?

2019-10-30 10:55:53	+DrAwesomeClaws_	i wouldn't buy cnc initially.  Just something like https://www.amazon.com/Klutch-Mini-Milling-Machine-Watts/dp/B01EGB61FQ  to get me starteed
2019-10-30 10:57:27	+Jonas___	I think I heard somewhere that the new one would be able to mill AK parts, but it's not in the feature list
2019-10-30 10:57:42	+DrAwesomeClaws_	whatever happened to that crazy 3d printed gun guy? That guy was everything i wanted to be when i was 14
2019-10-30 10:59:08	+Jonas___	I dunno, probably a combination of a lot of people not wanting to touch it with a pole, meaning funding dried up, and a 3d printed gun just not being very good
2019-10-30 10:59:26	+DrAwesomeClaws_	i think there was some prositute scandal or something as well
2019-10-30 10:59:53	+Jonas___	a prostitute scandal around the guy who promoted 3d printed guns?
2019-10-30 11:00:11	+Jonas___	the latter seems a bigger event than the former, so I don't see why that would be a big deal really
2019-10-30 11:00:23	+DrAwesomeClaws_	it wasn'y supposed to be good though.  He was doing it as a political stunt mostly.  Everyone arguing about whether one should be allowed to print guns or not... and was saying "there isn't a debate, you can do it now, here are the plans"
2019-10-30 11:00:28	+Jonas___	it's not like mr 3d printed guns for everyone is holding himself out as a paragon of virtue in the first place
2019-10-30 11:01:35	+DrAwesomeClaws_	Cody Wilson, that was his name.  he seems off, buy smart guy.  He seems like a south park character or something though

2019-10-30 11:04:09	+DrAwesomeClaws_	didn't realzie that
2019-10-30 11:04:23	+Jonas___	oh, I didn't know that
2019-10-30 11:04:32	+Jonas___	I guess that answers the "whatever happened to" question
2019-10-30 11:04:36	+DrAwesomeClaws_	yup
2019-10-30 11:05:03	+DrAwesomeClaws_	i prefer dot matrix printed guns
2019-10-30 11:05:12	+Jonas___	how to manufacture your own AR-15 lower in three easy steps
2019-10-30 11:05:26	+Jonas___	feds hate this one weird trick

2019-10-30 11:30:42	deniska	one of the elders responded "Guns? You don't need a 3d printer to make a gun"
2019-10-30 11:32:09	+DrAwesomeClaws_	haha

2019-10-31 17:13:51	+carefish	Jonas__: ...hmm something tells me you're still supposed to pay those taxes to sweden tho
2019-10-31 17:15:38	+Jonas__	Uhfgood, I would try booting the VM with your physical drive set as one of the virtual drives, and just try to boot from the install inside virtualbox

2019-10-31 17:16:18	+Jonas__	I think you have to use some special tools to get the physical drive mounted, but I believe it's possible.  not sure if you only want to use a specific partition but not the whole drive, though
2019-10-31 17:17:13	+carefish	ah, got an answer.. i was wrong
2019-10-31 17:17:25	Uhfgood	just the partition linux is installed on -- I do have that drive split into two partitions, one is an ntfs volume, and the other is my linux "drive" I had a 700gb hard disk, but didn't think I need to give up a whole half of that to the os
2019-10-31 17:17:32	+Jonas__	it might not want to boot because of "hardware changes", in which case it's probably easier to resolve it by just doing a fresh install and copying over relevant files, like someone suggested
2019-10-31 17:17:44	Uhfgood	okay
2019-10-31 17:18:06	+Jonas__	maybe it's possible to mount just a single partition of a physical drive, I've only done it with whole physical disks
2019-10-31 17:18:09	+Jonas__	worth a look at least
2019-10-31 17:18:21	Uhfgood	I've not done anything on this linux install, mostly because I'm waiting for a new usb wifi adapter -- so it's not that big of a deal
2019-10-31 17:18:39	+carefish	you have to report your 'goods' to the spanish tax agency, and if they are part of the Common Reporting Standard they will provide any other information as required

2019-10-31 17:19:03	+carefish	ie, you won't be taxed twice

2019-11-08 12:35:14	+DrAwesomeClaws	carefish, i read it online and tried it.  Probably pretty similar for most of the USA
2019-11-08 12:43:44	+DrAwesomeClaws	no other nation can compete with the USAF when it comes to snacks.
2019-11-08 12:44:19	+carefish	clearly they got their priorities straight
2019-11-08 12:45:21	+DrAwesomeClaws	my roomate and i found a loophole in that the snack bar didn't charge for buns and ketchup for the hot dogs.  When you don't have 25 cents for a hot dog you could just put some condiments on a bun for free
2019-11-08 12:45:56	+carefish	haha nice

2019-11-08 13:32:15	+DrAwesomeClaws	well the chow halls are free.  But those were only open at certain times and when you work nights you get out of work after they stop doing breakfast.   So the only chances to use them were 11-1 or 4-6
2019-11-08 13:32:26	+DrAwesomeClaws	free if you lived on base
2019-11-08 13:32:35	+DrAwesomeClaws	otherwise you get extra money each month
2019-11-08 13:33:34	+DrAwesomeClaws	but if you live on base and work nights, you can only eat for free 3 hours after work or 6 hours before
2019-11-08 13:34:12	+DrAwesomeClaws	or 5 or whatever the math was
2019-11-08 13:34:44	+DrAwesomeClaws	that's why there are so many bad marriages.   If you get married you get to move off base immediately and get a bunch of money for food and housing
2019-11-08 13:34:53	+DrAwesomeClaws	no room inspections

2019-11-13 11:09:37	+carefish	i don't like their reasoning either tbh
2019-11-13 11:10:43	+carefish	imo a custom language, no matter how 'simplified' it is, is increading complexity, not reducing it imo.
2019-11-13 11:11:58	+carefish	their second argument that it makes maintenance easier also sounds like the exact opposite: anytime someone finds a bug with your custom language... it might be hard to locate/solve/etc, whereas with a standard implementation of python or any other language you can, generally, assume its your wrapping code that's messing things up rather than the script language itself
2019-11-13 11:13:14	+carefish	when that page claims it would have been a worse experience to use other embeddable language, isn't that them admitting their architecture sucks for adding any scripting language?
2019-11-13 11:13:51	+carefish	and they close with 'why not just give it a try' after giving these (imo) non-arguments as to why gdscript was a better choice
2019-11-13 11:16:12	+carefish	their list of motivations imo only reads like 'yeah it was too much work, so we decided to make our own scripting language'
2019-11-13 11:17:01	+carefish	poor thread support? i disagree here, some of the vm's they're mentioning explicitly tell you to add your own threading model on top of it if you require it

2019-11-13 11:17:31	+carefish	i kind-of agree with the poor class-extending supprot, i'll give em that.
2019-11-13 11:18:13	+carefish	no 3 is actually very weird to say, cause imo only python is a bit weird to embed but stuff like google's v8 or spidermonkey is kinda straight forward in c++
2019-11-13 11:18:57	+carefish	no native vector types is... a super weird argument, because that entirely depends on how you decide to add or implement a scripting language
2019-11-13 11:19:26	+carefish	w/ google's v8 for example, you can bind native types to their js-object counter parts
2019-11-13 11:20:07	+carefish	i'm quite sure other languages like lua and python offer similar if not the same mechanics to help with 'housekeeping' between VM objects and 'native' objects
2019-11-13 11:20:50	+carefish	GC collector issues would also happen with your own scripting language, unless you don't have any which is unlikely if they modelled their gdscript after python
2019-11-13 11:21:31	+carefish	the last one absolutely is weird, because when i look at C# for visual studio code... that also uses a 'language server' to provide completion and whatnot
2019-11-13 11:22:05	+carefish	or looking at haxe, which also offers code completion through a 'language server'
2019-11-13 11:29:37	deniska	well, for me it wouldn't make a huge difference whether it's gdscript or haxe
2019-11-13 11:29:43	deniska	both are obscure languages :)
2019-11-13 11:40:55	+carefish	i wouldn't call haxe obscure tho
2019-11-13 11:41:12	+carefish	https://haxe.org/use-cases/who-uses-haxe.html
2019-11-13 11:41:22	+carefish	some pretty darn big names on there
2019-11-13 11:42:06	+carefish	granted, it might still be a niche language
2019-11-13 11:43:39	mursu	definitely a niche language
2019-11-13 11:43:46	mursu	but not as niche as GDScript lol
2019-11-13 11:44:59	+carefish	also general purpose vs engine specific
2019-11-13 11:46:45	mursu	that too
2019-11-13 11:47:39	mursu	though GDScript isn't THAT bad if you are already familiar with programming it's still annoying to have to constantly check the reference
2019-11-13 11:48:22	yuken	I liked Godot from what I used of it, although I still dunno if I want to stick with it for any of my future games.
2019-11-13 11:49:25	mursu	anything bad/good that sticks out?
2019-11-13 11:50:14	yuken	Right now, no headless/server C# builds. Other than that, not really.
2019-11-13 11:50:21	+carefish	i don't want to learn some wonky language with poorly supported design choices other than 'we know what we're doing'-type of explanation
2019-11-13 11:51:24	+carefish	lua, C#, python, js, the establised languages all have committee's and such
2019-11-13 11:51:44	mursu	you can always use C++ with Godot if you feel so inclined
2019-11-13 11:51:55	+carefish	hehe
2019-11-13 11:52:03	+carefish	i don't ever intend to use godot

2019-11-13 11:52:24	+carefish	lack of the standard things under the guise of being open is a poor fit for me :p
2019-11-13 11:52:43	+carefish	fbx being proprietary should still be a simple tickbox in installation for most end-users
2019-11-13 11:53:01	+carefish	rather than having to get it through plugins
2019-11-13 11:53:11	yuken	I'm still itnerested in https://amethyst.rs

2019-11-13 11:54:08	+carefish	don't get me wrong btw, i appload anyone using godot and making great games/apps with it. it's just not for me.
2019-11-13 11:56:04	mursu	I think the plugin issue is an issue with plugins in general rather than godot specific though

2019-11-13 11:57:12	+carefish	but it feels kind-of weird for a game engine not to have an industry standard included because of licensing issues

2019-11-13 17:50:42	aeth	bomb: The big engines with their own proprietary editors (in the sense of only works with them, so including Godot) tend to be more aimed at artists than programmers imo. If your strength is programming you might as well use a framework instead.

2019-11-14 09:34:18	mursu	did someone mention Ogre3D??
2019-11-14 09:34:18	+bomb	a horde of them!
2019-11-14 09:34:58	+bomb	author of Irrlicht also has a commercial WYSIWYG game engine called CopperCube
2019-11-14 09:35:43	+Jattenalle	*mumbles something about making your own engine and kids these days*
2019-11-14 09:35:46	+Jattenalle	*spits in a bucket*
2019-11-14 09:35:59	+Jattenalle	we didnt have none of these newfangled "ehngines" when i started
2019-11-14 09:36:09	+Jattenalle	had to code our own things! uphill! both ways!
2019-11-14 09:36:16	+Jattenalle	peek and poke raw memory addresses!
2019-11-14 09:36:24	deniska	well, you had fixed pipeline, it was easier :P
2019-11-14 09:37:37	aeth	GZdoom has (experimental?) Vulkan support... https://github.com/coelckers/gzdoom/tree/3467e0edcfee93ee3a6a47f7f1429fa7c6e8158d/src/rendering/vulkan
2019-11-14 09:37:38	+bomb	come on now. Irrlich Engine started in 2003 by programmer nicknamed... Irllicht
2019-11-14 09:37:48	aeth	The oldest of the mentioned engignes is probably the most modern...
2019-11-14 09:37:59	aeth	(Probably because there's more freedom to do so)
2019-11-14 09:39:08	deniska	it's probably not that hard to make new backends if you don't have slopes :)
2019-11-14 09:40:02	aeth	I mean, this isn't Wolfenstein 3D we're talking about
2019-11-14 09:41:42	+bomb	is Qt Creator nice or shite
2019-11-14 09:41:44	aeth	Modern Doom maps even found some way around the classic restriction of no-floors-above-other-floors. The most popular megawad, Scythe 2, has a (small) bridge very early on.
2019-11-14 09:41:47	aeth	I think the modern Doom map restriction is that you can have one floor above, at least in limited circumstances.
2019-11-14 09:41:58	aeth	Now, anyone should be able to render Wolf3D maps
2019-11-14 09:42:48	deniska	bomb: it's an ok C++ IDE
2019-11-14 09:43:03	aeth	(Of course, even modern Doom isn't like Quake 1, where the whole campaign's level geometry screams "look up and look down because you can do that now".)
2019-11-14 09:43:12	deniska	pretty decent for an IDE not named "Visual Studio"
2019-11-14 09:43:22	+bomb	FWIW I'm new to C++
2019-11-14 09:43:27	aeth	s/modern Doom/modern classic Doom, because they have to do reboots with the same name for some damn reason,/
2019-11-14 09:43:38	+bomb	I have VS installed but I don't want to be tied to Microsoft Corporation
2019-11-14 09:43:44	aeth	deniska: A merely ok C++ IDE doesn't sound very OK
2019-11-14 09:43:56	mursu	Now I have a hankering to play some Doom
2019-11-14 09:44:00	mursu	the classic
2019-11-14 09:44:03	+bomb	and Code::Blocks looks less OK than Qt Creator
2019-11-14 09:44:04	deniska	If you stick to Qt, Qt Creator essentially provides delphi/vb-like experience :)
2019-11-14 09:44:49	+bomb	heh, I can uninstall Lazarus finally :P
2019-11-14 09:45:26	deniska	plop controls onto a form, add handlers, stumble your way through autocompletion :)
2019-11-14 09:45:38	deniska	Or, as we called it back in a day, RAD
2019-11-14 09:45:55	+bomb	send masculine signals to sluts
2019-11-14 09:48:15	aeth	I don't use an IDE with C++. I considered trying a few IDE-style plugins for Emacs, but I just settled on raw, vanilla Emacs.
2019-11-14 09:48:31	aeth	If I make a simple mistake, the compiler tells me pretty much right away, anyway.
2019-11-14 09:48:54	aeth	s/considered trying/considered using/
2019-11-14 09:48:55	+bomb	I can smell the odor of your balls from here aeth
2019-11-14 09:49:12	deniska	M-x balls
2019-11-14 09:49:41	aeth	I mean, it's usually obvious if the API is good and when it's not obvious or too verbose (e.g. iterators) just auto it.
2019-11-14 09:49:59	aeth	Although maybe Qt is just too bloated.
2019-11-14 09:50:04	deniska	AAA stands for almost always auto
2019-11-14 09:50:34	+bomb	Qt is bloated by design. we're talking about Qt Creator
2019-11-14 09:50:56	aeth	why isn't it called Qreator?
2019-11-14 09:51:07	aeth	or maybe QreaTor
2019-11-14 09:51:16	+bomb	Qreatr
2019-11-14 09:51:19	deniska	it's Qt, not QT
2019-11-14 09:51:33	deniska	QT is QuickTime :P
2019-11-14 09:51:38	aeth	it's hard to emphasize in plain text without capitalizing
2019-11-14 09:51:45	+bomb	nobody said QT
2019-11-14 09:52:02	+bomb	also QT is Quentin Tarantino
2019-11-14 09:52:04	aeth	Is QuickTime still around? I haven't seen QuickTime or Real Player in maybe 15 years.
2019-11-14 09:52:16	mursu	quicktime still comes preinstalled on macs
2019-11-14 09:52:17	+bomb	it's still the default player on macOS
2019-11-14 09:52:29	aeth	lol
2019-11-14 09:52:38	mursu	also vim > emacs
2019-11-14 09:52:47	mursu	:^)
2019-11-14 09:53:07	+bomb	I miss watching TV on RealPlayer with 72p resolution
2019-11-14 09:53:19	aeth	I mean, vim is a more efficient, but harder to learn editing experience. Emacs is a better extension platform and has a much better graphical version, though.
2019-11-14 09:53:33	mursu	And better support for lisp
2019-11-14 09:53:45	aeth	Well, I mean, I praise Emacs even though Emacs Lisp is probably the second worst Lisp after AutoLISP
2019-11-14 09:53:49	+bomb	guys. we're talking about C++ and we're talking about getting shit done
2019-11-14 09:53:59	+bomb	nobody gives rat's ass about lisp
2019-11-14 09:54:18	mursu	why get shit done when you can configure your text editor for hundreds of hours
2019-11-14 09:54:32	mursu	and then never use it!
2019-11-14 09:54:35	aeth	you say that but once you have it configured it's copy and paste
2019-11-14 09:54:46	+bomb	also my vimrc is like 20 lines
2019-11-14 09:54:51	+bomb	I hate plugins
2019-11-14 09:54:54	aeth	The adoption cost of Emacs is high, but once you have it, every text based problem looks like a nail to Emacs's hammer.
2019-11-14 09:55:20	deniska	I tried both emacs and vim, liked vim way of doing things more
2019-11-14 09:55:30	aeth	bomb: My .emacs is probably like 80-100 lines, mostly to make it more readable and probably could be closer to 40. When Emacs integrated a package manager that got rid of most of my .emacs
2019-11-14 09:55:33	mursu	my init.vim is 117 lines :/
2019-11-14 09:55:43	+bomb	lolwut @ https://www.facebook.com/100006735798590/posts/2547632585471243/
2019-11-14 09:56:34	aeth	If that's the Carmack post: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21533661
2019-11-14 09:58:21	deniska	emacs is like a blaster, vim is like a lightsaber, an elegant weapon for a more civilized age
2019-11-14 09:58:34	deniska	ok, #badanalogy
2019-11-14 09:59:52	aeth	Emacs is like the second Death Star... very powerful, but some assembly required
2019-11-14 10:00:27	aeth	Or maybe it's like the first Death Star... in that if anyone wanted to attack it I'm sure they could so oh my god why do people run web servers in emacs
2019-11-14 10:00:44	mursu	also say what you want about Emacs Lisp but nothing is worse than vimscript
2019-11-14 10:00:55	aeth	eh
2019-11-14 10:01:12	aeth	the worst language people are using today in serious contexts is probably MUMPS
2019-11-14 10:01:27	mursu	probably yeah
2019-11-14 10:02:25	aeth	Of course, there is no best programming language, but there is a worst one, and there are enough contenders (excluding joke esolangs) that I'm not sure if it's MUMPS.
2019-11-14 10:03:57	+bomb	AETH https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/985671860418416645
2019-11-14 10:04:56	mursu	vi != vim
2019-11-14 10:05:19	aeth	bomb: he's not using NeXT anymore?
2019-11-14 10:05:19	+bomb	same shit
2019-11-14 10:06:03	+bomb	did he ever?
2019-11-14 10:06:31	aeth	Do you really think that they could have written the first FPSes inside of DOS?
2019-11-14 10:06:48	aeth	In the old days, you used Unix workstations for serious things
2019-11-14 10:07:13	aeth	(Nowadays, you use Linux workstations for serious things.)
2019-11-14 10:07:20	+bomb	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEBUV_g9vU
2019-11-14 10:07:35	deniska	If gamedevs were forced to use low-middle ranged machines, we'd get games with nicer minimal requirements :)
2019-11-14 10:07:45	+zebbiz_pi	Maybe
2019-11-14 10:08:07	+zebbiz_pi	Well, yes, but we wouldn't get those really pretty games
2019-11-14 10:08:20	aeth	You need more powerful dev machines than target machines, especially in the old days... You have workflows like compiling levels, which you don't want to take all day and the user will never have to do this.
2019-11-14 10:08:37	deniska	> and the user will never have to do this
2019-11-14 10:08:40	aeth	Maybe today's level formats aren't compiled, but lighting calculations probably more than took over that wait time
2019-11-14 10:08:40	+bomb	deniska: I have two Intel Asus powered netbooks on the desk exactly for that purpose
2019-11-14 10:08:53	deniska	Hey! Users should be able to compile levels if they choose to
2019-11-14 10:09:30	aeth	deniska: Yes, but the user can compile a map overnight. They'll finish their mod 20 years later, anyway.
2019-11-14 10:10:36	deniska	map compilers typically have -nolighting -notextures -nogeometrychecks -lookslikegarbage compiler flags you can supply during development cycles :)
2019-11-14 10:10:46	aeth	And it's still probably at least 300:1 unless the gimmick is map editing, in which case you might want something Minecraft-style... real-time multiplayer editing

2019-11-14 10:19:24	+bomb	deniska: well fucking done. they look great
2019-11-14 10:19:41	deniska	bomb: The idea of making level geometry in a 3d model editor and then importing it to a 3d engine still feels extremely weird to me :)
2019-11-14 10:20:46	aeth	deniska: right, it makes no sense to me, either
2019-11-14 10:21:06	aeth	models aren't game maps
2019-11-14 10:21:26	+bomb	deniska: hundred percent agree. CSG all the way
2019-11-14 10:21:51	+bomb	so do you still use Hammer Editor?
2019-11-14 10:21:55	aeth	Games these days focus way too much on looks over gameplay clarity so half the SP games with photorealism have to put in a cheat-ish mode where it highlights the interactable items.
2019-11-14 10:22:32	deniska	Making textures with actual photos is quick and yields great results
2019-11-14 10:23:23	aeth	Imo, there needs to be a gameplay equivalent to Chekhov's gun. If there's a rifle on the wall, you better be able to press Use and equip it.
2019-11-14 10:23:23	+bomb	shit deniska you're like a diamond in mud
2019-11-14 10:24:06	aeth	deniska: Realistic textures aren't really the problem, the problem is, well, everything else. Detail clutter.
2019-11-14 10:25:03	deniska	aeth: my pet peeve is all these games which have cars which have a better condition look than some cars on my street, and you can't ride them :)
2019-11-14 10:25:18	+bomb	deniska: show me the true path. you're my prophet. tell me what I need to make 99-2000 era 3D levels today
2019-11-14 10:25:24	aeth	deniska: clearly, no gas
2019-11-14 10:25:30	deniska	No, I'm saying my maps probably look nice because I use textures cut from photos of the actual place :)
2019-11-14 10:26:07	deniska	And yes, I still have VHE installed on some computers I use :)
2019-11-14 10:26:17	aeth	deniska: no fuel :-)
2019-11-14 10:26:36	aeth	deniska: And I mean, on the other hand, my pet peeve with old school map design (which you can see in CS:GO today, since they just keep redoing the same maps) is areas you can't go in, particularly when they were going for an outdoor urban environment
2019-11-14 10:27:02	aeth	I see CS:GO and I see a window I'd like to be able to shoot from instead of just walking down the obvious alleyway. Of course, those windows are fake.
2019-11-14 10:27:09	aeth	s/CS:GO/Counterstrike/
2019-11-14 10:27:33	+bomb	I loved Tomb Raider 3 levels
2019-11-14 10:27:41	aeth	The best cover is off limits in old school outdoor urban maps...
2019-11-14 10:27:42	+bomb	so immersive
2019-11-14 10:28:03	+bomb	I felt like I was really in a jungle
2019-11-14 10:28:18	aeth	jungles are tricky, there's so much going on
2019-11-14 10:29:20	aeth	The Hitman reboot game (because again they just have to call reboots the franchise name so I can never refer to them properly) had some great map environments. I mean, besides the whole issue of good luck finding interactables without cheat-vision.
2019-11-14 10:29:59	aeth	I mean, gameplay needs to catch up with graphics because in some distant future you'll be able to pick up and throw just about any object, with essentially no decoration objects.
2019-11-14 10:30:04	deniska	aeth: or even worse, "do not cross" tape is invisible wall :)
2019-11-14 10:30:08	mursu	I think the point of the Hitman reboot games is to use cheatvision until you remember the whole level and then do it on the harder difficulty
2019-11-14 10:30:22	+bomb	wtf is Hitman reboot
2019-11-14 10:30:40	aeth	bomb: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman_(2016_video_game)
2019-11-14 10:30:42	+bomb	there are only two hitman games: Hitman: Codename 47 and Hitman 2: Silent Assassin
2019-11-14 10:30:43	mursu	Hitman and Hitman 2
2019-11-14 10:30:49	aeth	I guess I should just call it Hitman 2016 like it's some sports game...
2019-11-14 10:30:56	aeth	I guess it's technically a hunting game...
2019-11-14 10:31:02	mursu	if you havent' played the new Hitman games they're really good
2019-11-14 10:31:12	+bomb	hmm
2019-11-14 10:31:21	+bomb	so how to make Hitman 1 maps today?
2019-11-14 10:31:33	+bomb	deniska refused to share his wisdom
2019-11-14 10:31:37	aeth	Hitman 2016 is a good example of how to make something feel alive. And you can go into most of the rooms that you'd want to go into. Enough to make you not really notice the ones where you can't.
2019-11-14 10:32:06	mursu	Mafia 3 has that problem too
2019-11-14 10:32:38	mursu	Mafia 3 has dumb walls of bushes too
2019-11-14 10:32:49	aeth	Well Mafia 3 is open world like GTA afaik.
2019-11-14 10:32:53	mursu	yeah
2019-11-14 10:33:03	aeth	Open world is, well, I don't really like open world because the scale's all wrong and you can barely go inside of anything.
2019-11-14 10:33:36	aeth	Contrast an open world game with Hitman 2016 or Deus Ex Mankind Divided's hub world. Much smaller levels, but you can find a way inside almost anything, even if it's a very roundabout, tricky way.
2019-11-14 10:33:41	mursu	scaling the breadth instead of depth
2019-11-14 10:34:04	+bomb	how do you make maps, though?
2019-11-14 10:34:16	mursu	Maya
2019-11-14 10:34:19	mursu	:^)
2019-11-14 10:34:35	 *	bomb stabs himself in the eyes
2019-11-14 10:35:46	+bomb	wtf i searched deniska and all the results are porn...  https://duckduckgo.com/?q=deniska&t=ffab&ia=web
2019-11-14 10:35:52	mursu	lol
2019-11-14 10:36:20	aeth	bomb: wtf i searched your irc name and all of the results are "Please See Your FBI Agent, We're Very Disappointed In You"
2019-11-14 10:37:51	+bomb	:)
2019-11-14 10:38:09	deniska	bomb: what engine is Hitman?
2019-11-14 10:38:21	+bomb	not Hammer deniska
2019-11-14 10:38:32	deniska	hammer is not an engine, it's a tool :P
2019-11-14 10:38:42	+bomb	lol, I mean not source :P
2019-11-14 10:38:49	aeth	If it's a AAA game and it looks good I assume it's UE4
2019-11-14 10:39:01	aeth	Unless it's specifically on some custom engine :-p
2019-11-14 10:39:10	mursu	I was under the assumption it was custom but I have no clue
2019-11-14 10:39:13	deniska	custom engines are so 2003
2019-11-14 10:39:16	+bomb	aeth won't you shut up for a sec, deniska will reveal his secret now
2019-11-14 10:39:45	 *	bomb stares at deniska 
2019-11-14 10:40:10	aeth	there's only done d...a that matters in gamedev and that's Daikatana. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daikatana
2019-11-14 10:40:21	+bomb	aeth: he's not talking. I hope you're happy
2019-11-14 10:40:43	deniska	bomb: 1) download VHE, 2) git gud
2019-11-14 10:41:26	+bomb	yeah, looks like it's gonna be easier to find a tool or write one to import BSP
2019-11-14 10:41:33	aeth	fun fact: Daikatana and (the original) Deus Ex were both released in 2000 by Ion Storm
2019-11-14 10:41:35	deniska	and wally for making texture WADs
2019-11-14 10:41:36	+bomb	(assuming it's still the format VHE uses)
2019-11-14 10:41:57	deniska	bomb: VHE uses either .rmf or .map to store the source, bsp is an output of a compiler
2019-11-14 10:42:36	+bomb	hmm
2019-11-14 10:43:21	+bomb	Hammer Editor looks like Leadwerks editor actually
2019-11-14 10:47:06	deniska	https://i.imgur.com/qJV6sIH.png I was also experimenting with level design in blender (same office scene)
2019-11-14 10:47:56	deniska	but the fact that my work computer is a potato which can't even run blender 2.79 properly made me lose interest :)
2019-11-14 10:48:26	aeth	I think that that's the wrong level of detail to work at.
2019-11-14 10:49:12	aeth	Maps should be designed in some simple editor, and their contents should be proc genned to be filled with stuff made in 3D model editors.
2019-11-14 10:49:22	aeth	That's probably the right use of proc gen in map design...
2019-11-14 10:50:08	aeth	Making a map in Blender just encourages you to put a barrel (or in that case a computer monitor) directly into the map like that.
2019-11-14 10:51:04	+bomb	the problem with level design in Blender isn't the geometry
2019-11-14 10:51:08	deniska	props are good to give a sense of scale (well, that'd be a separate entity, not part of level geometry)
2019-11-14 10:51:14	+bomb	Blender's texture workflow is weird
2019-11-14 10:51:44	deniska	yeah, I'm almost tempted to make a plugin for making texture workflow more VHE-sque :)
2019-11-14 10:52:13	+bomb	also if you disliked 2.79, give 2.80 a try. it's much better
2019-11-14 10:52:16	deniska	it's not just blender, most 3d editors with orbiting bound to middle mouse button work like that :P
2019-11-14 10:52:32	deniska	I liked 2.79
2019-11-14 10:52:50	deniska	left click to select in 2.80 throws me off actually :)
2019-11-14 10:53:05	+bomb	you can change that
2019-11-14 10:53:27	deniska	sure, but then I'll have to change that option forever and ever on every blender I set up
2019-11-14 10:53:42	deniska	I prefer to stick with defaults nowadays

2019-11-14 11:17:20	+bomb	can't we at least use Maven with it?
2019-11-14 11:23:04	mursu	what have you programmed in before?
2019-11-14 11:23:24	mursu	if anything
2019-11-14 11:24:29	mursu	other than Java??
2019-11-14 11:25:27	+bomb	Python, JavaScript professionally. Lua, some C, Erlang, Haxe and few others as hobby

2019-11-14 11:29:13	mursu	I think if you want to do C++ you'll probably want to use something like CMake as your build system
2019-11-14 11:29:53	mursu	I'm not up to date on the terminology used
2019-11-14 11:30:11	+bomb	lol mursu I literally came to ask if I should cmake first
2019-11-14 11:30:30	+bomb	also just jpined #cmake channel and opened a cmake tutorial on youtube XD
2019-11-14 11:31:15	+bomb	mursu: so if I get real good at CMake, dealing with dependencies won't be an issue, right? I can finally focus on C++-the-language?
2019-11-14 11:33:20	mursu	maybe
2019-11-14 11:33:53	+bomb	what did you quit C++ for?
2019-11-14 11:34:55	mursu	web development job /_\
2019-11-14 11:35:19	+bomb	:(
2019-11-14 11:42:46	deniska	modern C++ is much more approachable than 15 years old C++
2019-11-14 11:46:41	deniska	AAA gamedev is a strange world which mostly ignores modern C++ because they may target some weird m68k system using an older watcom compiler, or something
2019-11-14 11:48:02	mursu	probably should give C++ another shot
2019-11-14 11:48:41	mursu	instead of messing with functional programming languages and bad C wrapper libs
2019-11-14 11:50:15	deniska	jokes on you, C++ is now a functional programming language :P
2019-11-14 11:52:06	mursu	I think the word is multi-paradigm
2019-11-14 11:52:23	mursu	I can still write my garbage imperative code :^)
2019-11-14 11:52:57	mursu	I think it was Carmac who wrote a blog post about functional c++ programming?
2019-11-14 11:53:35	mursu	https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/169296/Indepth_Functional_programming_in_C.php this is the one
2019-11-14 12:00:48	+bomb	okay I created my first CMake project
2019-11-14 12:01:01	+bomb	do people usually start a CMake project first, then launch the IDE from generated project files
2019-11-14 12:01:13	+bomb	or the IDE handles everything already?
2019-11-14 12:05:31	+bomb	nvm
2019-11-14 12:05:40	+bomb	Qt Creators handles it beautifully
2019-11-14 12:05:52	+bomb	it creates a CMakeLists.txt file and it just works

2019-11-25 13:43:42	+Jattenalle	deniska, then your 1TB Aliexpress SSD arrives, and it's a 2MB USB thumbdrive in a 2.5" enclosure with a USB to SATA interface :P
2019-11-25 13:43:55	+Jattenalle	see, the 1TB is the NAME of the product :3
2019-11-25 13:44:12	+Jattenalle	the full name is: "Real SSD, 1TB capacity!"
2019-11-25 13:44:13	+Jattenalle	:P
2019-11-25 13:49:39	deniska	I actually bought a 720gb ssd sata from aliexpress, works fine, certainly has at least 200gb of real capacity :D
2019-11-25 13:50:09	+Jattenalle	hehe
2019-11-25 13:50:30	+Jattenalle	how much did it cost with shipping? pretty cheap?
2019-11-25 14:01:48	deniska	I think it was around 70usd?
2019-11-25 14:01:59	+Jattenalle	not bad
2019-11-25 14:03:39	deniska	sellers often advertise free shipping because 70usd free shipping seems like a better deal than 50usd + 20usd shipping :)

2019-11-25 14:31:20	+Jonas___	I thought the thing to do in the US was advertise a price that is after you deduct some sort of weird rebate coupon that you have to jump through 10 different diffuse hoops to get, in the hopes that most people will forget to use it
2019-11-25 14:35:47	+Jattenalle	Jonas___, also always pre-tax
2019-11-25 14:36:01	+Jonas___	I forgot about that clutch trick
2019-11-25 14:36:03	+Jattenalle	that still makes no sense to me... how prices are always without the tax, even in grocery stores
2019-11-25 14:36:44	+Jattenalle	"It says $10 on the label" -"Yeah, that's not what it costs though."
2019-11-25 14:36:44	+Jonas___	the thing is that tax varies by county, I believe, so they do it that way to avoid stores getting utterly fucked by being in a high-tax county next to a low-tax one
2019-11-25 14:36:45	+Jattenalle	-_^
2019-11-25 14:37:11	+Jattenalle	sure, but it just... it's scummy
2019-11-25 14:37:23	+Jonas___	which is understandable from the store perspective, but it's not really convenient for the consumer
2019-11-25 14:37:28	+Jattenalle	get to the checkout and it's just... more
2019-11-25 14:37:38	+Jattenalle	they know people wont turn around at checkout either, social pressure
2019-11-25 14:37:42	+Jattenalle	"We live in a society!"
2019-11-25 14:37:42	+Jattenalle	:P
2019-11-25 14:37:49	+Jonas___	presumably all americans know that this is how it works though, so I wouldn't call it deceptive really
2019-11-25 14:38:15	+Jattenalle	it's still deceptive imo, just because people know doesn't change it
2019-11-25 15:02:45	+DrAwesomeClaws_	bigger stores would also have to print a shitload of different price tags and advertisements, one for each different tax area.  Most of the time that's just states, rarely are sales taxes different below the state level
2019-11-25 15:03:04	+DrAwesomeClaws_	but that's still be 50 different price tags you need to print for each item if you sell stuff nation wide
2019-11-25 15:03:56	+DrAwesomeClaws_	and it decouples the price for advertising/marketing purposes
2019-11-25 15:06:23	+Jattenalle	having county different taxes for goods is also weird
2019-11-25 15:06:26	+Jattenalle	the US is weird.
2019-11-25 15:06:29	+Jattenalle	i have spoken.
2019-11-25 15:08:04	+DrAwesomeClaws_	like i said, it's almost never by county
2019-11-25 15:09:06	+DrAwesomeClaws_	having it by state is just because the federal government doesn't have any sales tax.  They leave it to the states to decide if they want to implement one or not
2019-11-25 15:09:10	+DrAwesomeClaws_	some don't have any sales tax
2019-11-25 15:09:38	+Jattenalle	really?
2019-11-25 15:09:40	+Jattenalle	TIL
2019-11-25 15:10:32	+DrAwesomeClaws_	Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon
2019-11-25 15:10:50	+DrAwesomeClaws_	usually they have more toll roads or higher property taxes
2019-11-25 15:12:02	+Jattenalle	that's so foreign to me.. here VAT/sales tax is just everywhere
2019-11-25 15:12:53	+DrAwesomeClaws_	i think Alaska is the only state with no sales nor income taxes
2019-11-25 15:12:59	+DrAwesomeClaws_	but they're rich with oil
2019-11-25 15:13:15	+Jattenalle	also makes sense due to population sparsity, no?
2019-11-25 15:13:25	+DrAwesomeClaws_	yeah, i imagine that plays in
2019-11-25 15:13:38	+Jattenalle	like i can see a historic reason for it.. hard to enforce tax when you have to cover basically a continent to get to that one dude in a cabin :P
2019-11-25 15:13:38	+DrAwesomeClaws_	each citizen actually gets a dividend from their oil reserves
2019-11-25 15:14:01	+Jattenalle	oh, so sort of like Norway is doing it with their nationalized funds thing
2019-11-25 15:14:11	+Jattenalle	sort of like how Norway*
2019-11-25 15:14:20	+DrAwesomeClaws_	yeah
2019-11-25 15:14:49	+DrAwesomeClaws_	looks like everyone in alaska gets about $1600/year from a quick google search
2019-11-25 15:16:18	+DrAwesomeClaws_	there's actually a pizza delivery service in alaska that delivers via airplane
2019-11-25 15:19:16	+Jattenalle	quite a few services like that, at least according to various documentaries set in alaska i've seen
2019-11-25 15:19:33	+DrAwesomeClaws_	i want to hike the skurka loop in alaska
2019-11-25 15:20:00	+DrAwesomeClaws_	http://andrewskurka.com/wp-content/uploads/route_map1.jpg
2019-11-25 15:20:03	+DrAwesomeClaws_	that's a hell of a hike
2019-11-25 15:20:17	+Jattenalle	that's like what, a 2 year hike?
2019-11-25 15:20:34	+DrAwesomeClaws_	6 month
2019-11-25 15:20:44	+Jattenalle	wow really? someone's in a hurry :P

2019-11-25 16:22:27	+Jonas___	nice, sounds like a keeper

2019-11-29 09:56:54	+carefish	yes
2019-11-29 09:57:07	+carefish	there's a few performance optimizations you can do in the shader
2019-11-29 09:57:37	+carefish	and you could make whichever artist you're working with really happy because you can help them make their stuff look even better
2019-11-29 10:01:08	+bomb	https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/

2019-11-29 10:03:00	+carefish	how's your maths
2019-11-29 10:03:16	deniska	learn opengl, you'll have to learn glsl to output a triangle :D
2019-11-29 10:03:24	+carefish	if that's not comfortable for you to use yet, go do some of those online linear algebra/trig courses
2019-11-29 10:03:38	+carefish	then do what deniska says

2019-11-29 10:04:18	+bomb	yay. I'll use that learnopengl website then
2019-11-29 10:04:26	+carefish	that one is pretty neat starter
2019-11-29 10:04:40	+carefish	https://open.gl/ another one
2019-11-29 10:04:56	deniska	https://open.gl this is the best opengl introduction I saw not counting NeHe tutorials, but NeHe tutorials are, uhm, old
2019-11-29 10:06:52	+bomb	old is good, old is reliable
2019-11-29 10:07:03	+bomb	I want to learn pre-GL3 stuff too
2019-11-29 10:09:47	deniska	I mean, you'll need some hairy compatibility layers to run older opengl on anything besides windows and linux
2019-11-29 10:10:13	deniska	NeHe is targeting opengl 1.4 I think?
2019-11-29 10:10:32	deniska	opengl2 already had shaders and such iirc
2019-11-29 10:10:34	+bomb	eh. does 1.4 even support custom shaders?
2019-11-29 10:10:39	deniska	I don't think so
2019-11-29 10:10:47	+bomb	screw Nestle then
2019-11-29 10:10:49	deniska	maybe with extensions?
2019-11-29 10:10:52	+bomb	let's try open.gl
2019-11-29 10:11:40	+bomb	it's weird tho. DX9 has all the fancy stuff, but its equivalent was 1.4?
2019-11-29 10:13:37	deniska	I think dx9 kinda corresponds to gl2.0?
2019-11-29 10:16:11	deniska	Fun fact: chinese release of dota 2 runs on opengl because through opengl it can access more modern features of a GPU than through dx9 available on winxp :)
2019-11-29 10:16:38	+bomb	weird
2019-11-29 10:19:01	deniska	winxp is (was?) weirdly overly popular in China

2019-11-29 10:21:53	+carefish	https://codepen.io/lynnandtonic/pen/NWWmzjr
2019-11-29 10:24:30	+bomb	maybe because winxp in a 512mb VM runs faster than non-virtualized win10
2019-11-29 10:27:58	deniska	Installing ancient OS on modern systems for some reason doesn't provide experience better than high end machines of the era an OS was released at
2019-11-29 10:28:43	deniska	Like if I install windows 7 on a threadripper it would feel exactly the same as windows 7 on a 2009 xeon :)
2019-11-29 10:30:56	deniska	I ran winxp on one of my machines relatively recently (~2012 or something), the only benefit I noticed was much lower hdd footprint (that was the sole reason to use xp because I ended up with 30gb of space)
2019-11-29 10:32:03	deniska	it's annoyingly hard to install, hard to find drivers, and nowadays hard to find working software

2019-12-11 10:29:36	+carefish	aeth: why not both?
2019-12-11 10:29:51	+carefish	i really hate that a lot of people don't really know how to use a computer
2019-12-11 10:30:16	+carefish	check the wires, reboot, try again before throwing a tantrum
2019-12-11 10:30:25	+carefish	just try some of the basic stuff to fix it please
2019-12-11 10:30:27	aeth	That hasn't really changed with generations, except that younger people who don't know how to use a computer at least can get as far as Netflix and Steam because TV is dead.
2019-12-11 10:31:00	+carefish	yeah
2019-12-11 10:31:03	+carefish	its a shame really
2019-12-11 10:31:29	+carefish	not that tv is dead, but that yung un's don't spend more tme with figuring out how it works
2019-12-11 10:32:20	aeth	Yes, TVs aren't that hard, you just need to know how to go through the menus with the remote control.
2019-12-11 10:33:28	+carefish	i mean, how would you entice (young) people to look a bit further than netflix/facebook/steam?
2019-12-11 10:33:51	+carefish	i don't think there's an easy answer for that, since some of the things computers do are straight up magic for those users
2019-12-11 10:34:12	+carefish	and it's hard to learn how to use something more effectively if it is essentially magic to you
2019-12-11 10:35:28	aeth	put a real computing environment in VR in a few VR generations when the resolution gets good for text, and gamify it
2019-12-11 10:35:35	+carefish	i think... the only way to entice this stuff is to help people create a 'better' vocabulary to ask questions
2019-12-11 10:37:03	+carefish	idk
2019-12-11 10:37:13	+carefish	today i think i'll mess with meshroom
