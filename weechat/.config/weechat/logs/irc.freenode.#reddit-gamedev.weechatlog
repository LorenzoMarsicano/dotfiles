2019-07-02 10:19:40	+carefish	however you still have the hard of hearing/bad/pisspoor eye sight like me... so maybe those things making noise is pretty good
2019-07-02 10:19:53	+carefish	automatic claxon would be nicer i guess
2019-07-02 10:21:44	+carefish	tho that would be even more annoying
2019-07-02 10:21:46	+carefish	hmm
2019-07-02 10:22:05	+carefish	i am not sure how to 'solve' the quietness of electric vehicles
2019-07-02 10:23:13	+Jonas___	we could mandate them making noises below 20km/h
2019-07-02 10:23:18	+Jonas___	just a thought
2019-07-02 10:24:02	+carefish	that's what they propose
2019-07-02 10:24:23	+zebbiz_pi	that's the joke
2019-07-02 10:24:40	+carefish	the problem i see there is, if manufacturers suddenly use all manner of noises... then how can we discern danger from all those noises? am i going to need to memorize all the noises of manufacturers?
2019-07-02 10:24:59	+carefish	there's no standardization or anything researched like this
2019-07-02 10:25:18	+carefish	iirc the nissan leaf has a weird 'spacey' sound when it revs up
2019-07-02 10:25:45	+carefish	which i didn't immediately recognize as 'hey, there's something of interest and a few hundred kg's you'll want to watch out for'
2019-07-02 10:26:02	+carefish	idk if it was a nissan leaf, i suck at remembering car manufacturers/models/makes
2019-07-02 10:28:21	TidB	Hm, let's hope this'll get regulated and standardised
2019-07-02 10:29:15	TidB	The could just use their slogan/brand as their sound
2019-07-02 10:29:22	TidB	nissannissannissannissannissan
2019-07-02 10:29:37	+carefish	hehe
2019-07-02 10:29:48	+carefish	i think going quieter is the solution
2019-07-02 10:30:04	+carefish	it'll force people to occasionally look up from their phones while they cross a crosswalk
2019-07-02 10:30:24	+zebbiz_pi	lol, that won't work
2019-07-02 10:30:29	+zebbiz_pi	people are stupid
2019-07-02 10:30:47	+carefish	cause that's the most baffling thing i've seen few times now of 16 y/o's absolutely not even looking left and right on a cross walk just assuming the clicker of the light thing is correct
2019-07-02 10:31:12	+carefish	while there is a fucking bus barreling towards that crosswalk and no signs of it stopping or slowing down
2019-07-02 10:32:12	TidB	That reminds me of spending some time in Italy and learning that noone cares about crosswalks
2019-07-02 10:32:51	+carefish	oh yeah
2019-07-02 10:32:55	+carefish	in europe crosswalks are kinda useless
2019-07-02 10:33:07	+carefish	they are way more of a guideline than an actual thing to abide by
2019-07-02 10:34:01	+carefish	compared to places like canada/america, where you definitely could cross a street/boulevard without a crosswalk... it tends to be kinda dangerous
2019-07-02 10:35:07	+carefish	i think the absolute worst for that is bangkok
2019-07-02 10:35:23	+carefish	crosswalks aren't safe, nor is the traffic very safe
2019-07-02 10:35:29	TidB	I dunno if Germany is an outlier then (stereotypical obedience to rules haha yes), but here crosswalks are respected like every time. I feel safe giong over crosswalks why a car is approaching (but I try to get into eye contact with the driver so it's actually safe)
2019-07-02 10:35:48	+carefish	yeah, germany is the odd one out here
2019-07-02 10:36:02	+carefish	it was lovely to be kinda afk in the head and wander around hanover
2019-07-02 10:36:40	+carefish	though to offset that... there's quite a bit of homeless in germany

2019-07-03 10:41:03	+zebbiz_pi	So I have to find which tests relate to which documented test case and write it into the code
2019-07-03 10:41:08	+zebbiz_pi	Correct
2019-07-03 10:41:16	+zebbiz_pi	Sometimes they are, but not completely
2019-07-03 10:41:29	+Jonas___	I guess someone has to link the tests to the tests then
2019-07-03 10:41:56	+zebbiz_pi	The fucker who wrote the tests and documentation should do it
2019-07-03 10:42:08	+Jonas___	you'd think so

2019-07-03 14:48:00	+Jonas___	it's one pair of 225/45 R17 91Y and one pair of 245/40 R17 91Y, but what brand is good, which one is overpriced and which one isn't is all greek to me
2019-07-03 14:50:09	+Jonas___	it feels like it's more than just the tire dimensions, like pattern, rubber composition, noise levels, etc
2019-07-03 14:50:39	+Jonas___	will it be too soft on the warm asphalt or too stiff on the cold asphalt?
2019-07-03 14:53:01	+zebbiz_pi	Jonas___: Will it only drive in spain?
2019-07-03 14:54:05	+Jonas___	yes, or if I decide to take it on a drive north I won't do it on the spain-tires during anything other than summer..but that's unlikely to happen in the first place
2019-07-03 14:58:52	+Jonas___	I guess I can just go on some random online review site and take their words for it

2019-07-03 15:24:59	+carefish	you might wanna double check what the spanish locals themselves do though
2019-07-03 15:25:27	+carefish	best thing to do is look which tires their copcars/taxi's are using
2019-07-03 15:28:41	n0tus	just buy new tires
2019-07-03 15:33:37	+Jonas___	all 4 wheels changed, approx €500, I think that might be cheaper than doing the same in sweden

2019-07-03 15:52:22	+DrAwesomeClaws	_ is a bad variable name there. _ usually implies not used / dont care
2019-07-03 15:53:34	+carefish	in C# you use it to discard whatever it is
2019-07-03 15:53:59	+carefish	or accept whatever it is, depending on how you look at it lmao
2019-07-03 15:56:19	+carefish	so imo it is properly used :P cause firstworldproblems.. /care
2019-07-03 15:57:42	n0tus	same with python and javascript and many other languages
2019-07-03 15:57:48	+DrAwesomeClaws	haha, im coming at it from a haskell /js angle.  Where it'd be something like foo = (_, __, varThatIActuallyCareAbout) { ... // _, __ never used otherwise we'd give them a real name }
2019-07-03 15:58:05	n0tus	js added _ support
2019-07-03 15:59:26	n0tus	the underscore in js is used for the same exact reason in python and C# afaik, its a discard
2019-07-03 15:59:42	+DrAwesomeClaws	yeah, but they dont need to add support for that
2019-07-03 15:59:45	+DrAwesomeClaws	just a convention
2019-07-03 15:59:56	+DrAwesomeClaws	though linters support it, they won't flag it as unused
2019-07-03 16:01:59	+carefish	i'm messing around with parallel linq stuff from C#
2019-07-03 16:02:16	+carefish	i wanna know how those can be beneficial vs. writing traditional for/foreaches
2019-07-03 16:02:57	+carefish	so far it seems like you need to pay some attention to how you layout your classes for it to be kinda beneficial as well as knowing how linq allocates things
2019-07-03 16:03:52	n0tus	ah i was probably thinking of linter support, i thought at one point it was giving me shit about _ so i assumed it was a change to the native language, makes more sense now as a convention
2019-07-03 16:03:58	+DrAwesomeClaws	well linq is a more functional approach.  Functional usually implies easier parrallelism because of purity of functions, no side effects / mutations
2019-07-03 16:04:19	+zebbiz_pi	Jonas___: Buy Nokia tires!
2019-07-03 16:04:21	+DrAwesomeClaws	afair anyway
2019-07-03 16:04:32	+DrAwesomeClaws	i haven't messed with linq in many years
2019-07-03 16:05:24	+Jonas___	zebbiz_pi, couldn't even find those here
2019-07-03 16:05:32	+Jonas___	maybe the spanish tire market is less lucrative without winter tires
2019-07-03 16:06:13	n0tus	yah plus its more expressive to operate on collections of data using LINQ vs a bunch of explicit for loops
2019-07-03 16:07:09	+carefish	yeah, i'm really enjoying linq so far
2019-07-03 16:08:00	n0tus	i rarely ever use for loops if i can avoid it, ill use map, filter, and reduce in js, or pull in a lib like lodash-fp or ramda
2019-07-03 16:08:37	+carefish	i'm so used to doing forloops, so linq is a nice breath of fresh air
2019-07-03 16:08:44	+DrAwesomeClaws	yeah, the only time i use for, or even mutate things, is for specific performance reasons these days.  I write pretty much everything functionally now
2019-07-03 16:10:00	+carefish	next step once i am comfy w/ linq is read up if/how you can use that SIMD vectorization stuff along with the parallelism w/ linq. might come in handy later

2019-07-08 10:01:17	yuken	Does anyone here know anything about GLSL? I'm trying to write some OpenGL 2.1 shaders, currently all tutorials I can come across that are relevant for what I'm using (gfx-rs in Rust) are using OpenGL 3.2
2019-07-08 10:01:48	yuken	and GLSL 150 shaders work differently from GLSL 120 apparently. Although, for some reason, I can use GLSL 150 shaders with an OpenGL 2.1 context.
2019-07-08 10:11:57	aeth	yuken: nvidia drivers?
2019-07-08 10:12:35	aeth	yuken: Nvidia drivers let you do wrong things. The people using Intel integrated on Linux will let you find out about that later on.
2019-07-08 10:12:55	aeth	The best GLSL material I know of is the wiki. https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language
2019-07-08 10:13:08	yuken	aeth, AMD.
2019-07-08 10:13:12	yuken	and on Linux.
2019-07-08 10:13:29	aeth	Also, there's a lot of documentation, e.g. http://docs.gl/
2019-07-08 10:13:37	yuken	well
2019-07-08 10:13:44	yuken	I have no clue how to use GLSL in the first place
2019-07-08 10:13:59	aeth	yuken: Well, I guess it's sort of an arms race like with web browser tech. Once someone starts accepting bad input they all have to so nothing breaks. You probably aren't supposed to do that, anyway. I'm just guessing, though.
2019-07-08 10:14:00	yuken	and I doubt that'll help me with GLSL from 2005.
2019-07-08 10:14:38	aeth	docs.gl tells you what's available in gl2, gl3, gl4.
2019-07-08 10:15:11	aeth	or one of the many similar sites
2019-07-08 10:15:22	yuken	oh god, I hav eno clue how gfx-rs is handling this as well
2019-07-08 10:15:27	yuken	it has a macro to setup... "stuff"
2019-07-08 10:15:32	aeth	The wiki often tells you when a feature is first available, e.g. the box on this page tells you "core since version 4.0" https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Tessellation
2019-07-08 10:16:25	yuken	https://gist.github.com/YukenK/774323fc1240dc77067c7ddaad9706ca is an example of said macro.
2019-07-08 10:21:47	yuken	oh god, I can't figure this crap out aeth.
2019-07-08 10:36:22	aeth	yuken: just use OpenGL 3, that seems to be where all of the tutorials are, unless they suddenly all moved to 4
2019-07-08 10:36:25	aeth	imo
2019-07-08 10:36:43	<--	mukunda (~mukunda@adsl-68-19-173-211.jan.bellsouth.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
2019-07-08 10:37:56	aeth	Most documentation/etc. seems to assume OpenGL 3.2 or OpenGL 3.3 with extra features noted so you can just use an extension or bump up the minimum version if necessary.
2019-07-08 10:38:49	yuken	aeth, I want to have wide support.
2019-07-08 10:39:12	aeth	OpenGL 2.x tends to just be people with bad drivers or weird combinations
2019-07-08 10:39:26	yuken	Or old hardware, which is what I'm trying to target.
2019-07-08 10:40:00	aeth	3.2 is 2009-08-03, so if you are supporting 10 years of hardware, it should run fine. Really, 3.x should run on hardware going back to 3.0, or 2008-08-11.
2019-07-08 10:40:23	yuken	I want to be able to build this on a Pentium Pro, aeth.
2019-07-08 10:40:28	IkeKrull	if its 2d, which i assume it is given your vertex buffer, you wont miss much with 2.1 except perhaps fbos/render to texture features
2019-07-08 10:41:12	yuken	Unless I add in a software renderer and just use OpenGL 3.2 or 4 for hardware accel.
2019-07-08 10:41:17	aeth	yuken: So you support 99.9% with 3.x and you want to support 99.99999%? Or something. Diminishing returns...
2019-07-08 10:41:51	aeth	You'll still need a software renderer for people with bad drivers, like me on Linux circa 2007, which is why I only played games with software renderers around that time.
2019-07-08 10:42:17	yuken	That's what I'm trying to avoid, I would rather shoot myself than deal with xlib/etc directly to write a software renderer, aeth
2019-07-08 10:42:38	aeth	What about SDL2's legacy 2D renderer? Or is it only hardware accelerated now?
2019-07-08 10:42:52	yuken	No clue, I'm not using SDL.
2019-07-08 10:43:17	aeth	There might be other 2D renderers. Weird to pull in a whole dependency that probably won't be used except as a fallback, but I'm sure some people do when they must have reliability
2019-07-08 10:43:48	yuken	There are no software 2D renderers I can use here, I'd have to write my own.
2019-07-08 10:44:00	aeth	ah
2019-07-08 10:44:32	yuken	I just don't see a benefit to using OpenGL 3 or 4, other than maybe some ease-of-use stuff .
2019-07-08 10:44:34	aeth	It might be easier than getting reliable OpenGL 2 information in 2019 outside of finding old books.
2019-07-08 10:45:09	aeth	Once you go OpenGL 3 you can progressively add features based on the capability of the graphics card with OpenGL extensions afaik. I've never bothered doing that, though.
2019-07-08 10:45:51	aeth	OpenGL 3.2 is kind of the baseline of that, although a lot choose 3.3 instead because in theory if your hardware supports 3.2 it supports 3.3. There are some people with bad drivers (I encountered them on IRC!) who can't run 3.3, though.
2019-07-08 10:45:56	yuken	My game is a tiny 2D MORPG that I plan to port to DOS (to give an example of how graphically intensive it is) as a project-for-fun
2019-07-08 10:46:08	yuken	with the most intensive thing being a day-night cycle that just applies a dark overlay.
2019-07-08 10:46:29	yuken	So what would the real benefit be?
2019-07-08 10:46:35	aeth	yuken: I think OpenGL is designed so you can run it as a software renderer if hardware acceleration isn't available? As well as just certain parts if there's only a partial OpenGL implementation.
2019-07-08 10:46:51	aeth	I'm not sure if they dropped that with 3
2019-07-08 10:46:54	yuken	If that's the case, that would be great.
2019-07-08 10:47:33	aeth	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10431591/opengl-software-rendering-alternatives
2019-07-08 10:48:19	aeth	It looks like as of 2014-08-25 Mesa 3D has 3 software implementations of OpenGL 3.1. It might be 3.2 by now, which gives you your baseline.
2019-07-08 10:48:34	aeth	Not sure about DOS, though
2019-07-08 10:48:43	yuken	wqell DOS, i'm rewriting the client.
2019-07-08 10:49:02	yuken	The client does no logic, just accepts/sends network info and renders stuff in its proper location.
2019-07-08 10:49:09	yuken	All other logic is done server-side.
2019-07-08 10:49:56	aeth	LLVMPipe and SoftPipe 3.3 in Mesa 17.1.0. https://people.freedesktop.org/~imirkin/glxinfo/#v=Mesa%2017.1.0
2019-07-08 10:50:12	aeth	That's the last feature table that contains all of the information on that site
2019-07-08 10:52:11	aeth	https://www.mesa3d.org/llvmpipe.html
2019-07-08 10:53:14	yuken	meh, I guess I'll use GLSL 150 & OpenGL 3.2 then.
2019-07-08 10:53:34	aeth	from the LLVMpipe page: "For x86 or amd64 processors, 64-bit mode is recommended. Support for SSE2 is strongly encouraged. Support for SSE3 and SSE4.1 will yield the most efficient code. The fewer features the CPU has the more likely it is that you will run into underperforming, buggy, or incomplete code."
2019-07-08 10:53:36	yuken	I'll be writing a software renderer for the DOS port, but that's simple enough in DOS, you just write to a specific memory address
2019-07-08 10:53:43	aeth	Wow I would not want to maintain the LLVMpipe code
2019-07-08 10:54:26	aeth	It's basically saying, "Here's all the things we'd like you to have and that would make our job easier. They're recommended, but not required, since this is for really old, bad computers anyway."
2019-07-08 10:55:26	aeth	I guess that's what happens when you have to support literally everything everywhere for all time.
2019-07-08 10:55:45	aeth	You only have to deal with the Pentium Pro.
2019-07-08 10:55:56	yuken	I'm supporting this old stuff more as a hobby because I hjad, at one point, a crpapy old computer in the modern era
2019-07-08 10:56:15	yuken	a T5250 + GMA 965/X3100 in 2014. Not, uh, a pleasant experience for someone who wanted to game.
2019-07-08 10:57:05	aeth	I can empathize. As I said, I didn't have working 3D drivers in the 2005-2007ish range. Although maybe with today's LLVMpipe I wouldn't notice (except for the framerate!)
2019-07-08 10:57:33	aeth	it's definitely the only way to support "everyone" on x86

2019-07-09 14:56:22	+carefish	y'know
2019-07-09 14:56:26	+carefish	screw you guys
2019-07-09 14:56:28	+carefish	:(
2019-07-09 14:56:30	+carefish	:P
2019-07-09 14:56:34	+Waynes	:D
2019-07-09 14:56:47	+Jattenalle	lol
2019-07-09 14:57:07	+Waynes	why learn anything if you can just import a library to do it for you
2019-07-09 14:57:33	+Waynes	programmers are just glorified Dr Frankensteins
2019-07-09 14:57:47	+carefish	through enough
2019-07-09 14:58:27	+carefish	and the ones that aren't frankenstein.... are probably either jekyll or hyde.
2019-07-09 14:58:59	+Jattenalle	true*
2019-07-09 15:00:27	+carefish	there's not enough caffein coarsing through my veins yet
2019-07-09 15:00:45	+Waynes	tried an infusion yet?
2019-07-09 15:01:50	+carefish	nah
2019-07-09 15:02:06	+carefish	i do kinda wish i had those electronical skills Jattenalle
2019-07-09 15:02:12	+carefish	it looks super simple
2019-07-09 15:02:21	+Jattenalle	spoiler: it is super simple
2019-07-09 15:02:44	+Jattenalle	kind of like programming, easy to get the basics.. the professionalism comes in knowing WHAT and HOW to use things
2019-07-09 15:02:49	+Waynes	electronics are stupid, every time you want to do something new you have to pay money
2019-07-09 15:04:11	+carefish	looks like a lot of fun too once you get the hang of it
2019-07-09 15:04:26	+carefish	which arguably is true for programming (...and many other things too)

2019-07-09 15:53:21	deniska	electronics is like programming, but a bug can also be a wire connected poorly
2019-07-09 15:53:33	deniska	and your only debug method is probably a LED.. which could be connected poorly

2019-07-09 15:54:38	deniska	well, not poorly in terms of connections, but connected wrong places :)

2019-07-09 16:30:10	+carefish	soo, another question popped in my mind today
2019-07-09 16:31:18	+carefish	stuff like rust and vulkan should go hand in hand right? can rust emit those as thread safe libraries with generated C header files?
2019-07-09 16:33:28	+Jattenalle	zebbiz_pi, just dip it in hotglue and ship it... "Production quality"
2019-07-09 16:35:29	+Waynes	anyone actually using rust?
2019-07-09 16:35:53	+zebbiz_pi	Waynes: Mozilla
2019-07-09 16:36:28	+Waynes	*anyone you know actually using rust?
2019-07-09 16:36:48	+Jattenalle	crazy people?
2019-07-09 16:37:13	+Waynes	rust seemed like too much work for me
2019-07-09 16:39:12	+carefish	well
2019-07-09 16:39:19	+carefish	i kinda see some future in it
2019-07-09 16:39:30	+carefish	with it's ability to spit out webassembly
2019-07-09 16:39:59	+Waynes	can't everything be compiled to webassembly these days
2019-07-09 16:40:03	+carefish	so you could abstract away platform specific rendering, and still have a webgame using webgl/canvas
2019-07-09 16:40:16	+shan	FUCk
2019-07-09 16:40:19	+Waynes	threads are still shit though
2019-07-09 16:40:21	+shan	i have a game to make
2019-07-09 16:40:32	+Waynes	shan: best of luck
2019-07-09 16:40:50	n0tus	i like rust, i personally like working with things like option and result types and the ability to reduce runtime errors with them, its the same thing that Elm does really well IMO, Elm is just more strict
2019-07-09 16:41:06	+shan	Waynes: do i work on the combat and movement first or do i build a playable demo showing off exploration and dialogue first
2019-07-09 16:41:14	+carefish	i don't know what elm is
2019-07-09 16:41:25	+Waynes	shan: doesn't a playable demo require movement
2019-07-09 16:41:38	+shan	Waynes: right, i already have movement
2019-07-09 16:41:40	+carefish	the other reason i was looking at rust is because it also seems to play nice with blazor's webassembly stuff
2019-07-09 16:42:02	n0tus	elm is a purely functional language for making web frontends
2019-07-09 16:42:06	+Waynes	shan: start with whatever is necessary to get the general feel of the game
2019-07-09 16:42:15	+shan	hmmmmm...
2019-07-09 16:42:19	n0tus	the most used architecture used in web frontends today which is flux and its derivatives, come from Elm
2019-07-09 16:42:27	+shan	but that means animations. I don't have animations.
2019-07-09 16:42:39	+Waynes	shan: so you waste less time if you find out that your game idea is not fun after all
2019-07-09 16:42:49	+Waynes	shan: don't need animations for that
2019-07-09 16:42:49	+carefish	mixamo animation packs shan
2019-07-09 16:42:52	+carefish	those are free.
2019-07-09 16:42:56	+shan	Waynes: looks like it'll be combat first, then
2019-07-09 16:43:19	+carefish	hm, ok
2019-07-09 16:43:34	+shan	carefish: thanks for tip, i'll do the animation right after i have a movement demo
2019-07-09 16:43:59	+carefish	also they have fighting moves in there
2019-07-09 16:44:05	+carefish	so you should be ok for a while
2019-07-09 16:44:16	+shan	carefish: are there robots
2019-07-09 16:44:26	+shan	also i REALLY wanna make a 3d game
2019-07-09 16:44:37	+Waynes	don't
2019-07-09 16:44:38	+carefish	grab unity, get moving
2019-07-09 16:44:43	+Waynes	you can't afford the assets
2019-07-09 16:44:59	+carefish	there's tons of free unity packages for prototyping though
2019-07-09 16:45:00	+shan	carefish: EWWW unity
2019-07-09 16:45:06	+shan	godot :)
2019-07-09 16:45:17	+carefish	if you want to know if your game idea is fun, imo unity gets that across really fast
2019-07-09 16:45:28	+carefish	i don't know how fast godot is in prototyping
2019-07-09 16:45:29	+shan	yee...

2019-07-10 10:40:18	+Jonas___	:(
2019-07-10 10:58:31	+carefish	yuken: no, you need to batch those calls yourself.
2019-07-10 11:00:24	yuken	right now, my drawing code looks like this: "for i in 0..xyz { canvas.copy(&texture, src, dst); } canvas.present()" carefish.
2019-07-10 11:00:36	yuken	GOt any good articles on draw batching, or should I GOogle it? :P
2019-07-10 11:00:51	+carefish	google, try it out, if it doesn't work ask questions and post links used
2019-07-10 11:00:56	yuken	mmkay.
2019-07-10 11:01:02	+carefish	seriously good to always google for that stuff
2019-07-10 11:01:08	+carefish	then try it out/poke at it
2019-07-10 11:01:23	+carefish	if either didn't work out, ask questions :p
2019-07-10 11:01:32	yuken	Right now, with software rendering in SDL, that above method is eating up 70% CPU
2019-07-10 11:01:36	yuken	on a 4GHz 4790k lul
2019-07-10 11:01:38	+carefish	but imo it's not too difficult.
2019-07-10 11:01:48	+carefish	yeah that's kinda bad
2019-07-10 11:01:58	yuken	I can't look anything up r/n, or I would have done that before asking. Weird internet situation here.
2019-07-10 11:02:01	+carefish	how do you know it's that for loop tho
2019-07-10 11:02:03	yuken	but I'll do it in an hour or so
2019-07-10 11:02:10	yuken	I commented it out, dropped to 0.1% load, carefish
2019-07-10 11:03:27	+carefish	so you might wanna batch your calls then ;)
2019-07-10 11:03:56	+carefish	anyway, common technique is to 'save' all the draw calls, and then send all of those at once at the end of the frame
2019-07-10 11:04:38	yuken	I'd assume with hardware acceleration, calling "canvas.copy" does that, and then "canvas.present" is what flushes it to the GPU
2019-07-10 11:04:45	yuken	but idk with software rendering.
2019-07-10 11:04:53	+carefish	ListOfObjectsToDraw.Add(sprite)
2019-07-10 11:05:03	+carefish	render.draw(ListOfObjects)
2019-07-10 11:05:38	yuken	oh, hm. pretty simple, I'll look at SDL2's Rust docs to see if it can render a list of stuff like that.
2019-07-10 11:06:29	yuken	I also got map loading, serde_json saved my ass - it can copy a strict-typed json file into a Rust struct suepr easily, so I can just do that and then generate a tile map from a Tiled map. https://gist.github.com/YukenK/a0a89129ffca0cfd71783bf16a747b28
2019-07-10 11:06:31	yuken	which is super awesome.
2019-07-10 11:07:09	+carefish	nice. always good to use tools for serialization when you're starting out imo
2019-07-10 11:08:05	yuken	I'm probably gonna use a good compression library to send the data over the network, too. Dunno what to pick though.
2019-07-10 11:08:07	+carefish	so you have to make sure the tile textures are on 1 opengl texture yuken, that should fix the lot of it
2019-07-10 11:08:13	yuken	LZ4 seems popular enough.
2019-07-10 11:08:14	+carefish	zlib
2019-07-10 11:08:18	+carefish	just use zlib
2019-07-10 11:08:31	yuken	carefish, no OpenGL here, software rendering. All the tile textures are, right now, on 1 png.
2019-07-10 11:08:40	yuken	1024x1024, and I'll create a 2nd 1024x1024 texture if I need more.
2019-07-10 11:08:42	+carefish	microsoft moved to using zlib in their compression streams in .net core
2019-07-10 11:08:57	yuken	what's the license on zlib?
2019-07-10 11:09:08	+carefish	idk, super permissive.
2019-07-10 11:09:18	+carefish	anyway, if all your textures are on 1 spritesheet already
2019-07-10 11:09:28	yuken	sounds good to me then. although, if I do wanna do a DOS port for fun, idk if I should compress stuff for that
2019-07-10 11:09:32	+carefish	then you gotta provide proper clipping masks and you're almost half way already
2019-07-10 11:09:35	yuken	seems like it would take longer to decompress than to send the data lul
2019-07-10 11:09:42	yuken	clipping masks, carefish?
2019-07-10 11:10:37	yuken	I assume those are essentially pointing to where the texture is in the file, right?
2019-07-10 11:12:53	+carefish	https://www.patreon.com/posts/project-sdl-21856507
2019-07-10 11:12:58	+carefish	that article looks promising.
2019-07-10 11:13:19	+carefish	ctrl-f for 'sdl_sethint"
2019-07-10 11:13:20	yuken	I'll check it out when I can, thanks. I would have Googled it first but again,w eird internet stuff r/n, so I'm just watching anime for an hour
2019-07-10 11:13:30	yuken	And thanks for putting up with my annoyances ;)
2019-07-10 11:14:52	yuken	So for my UI, I'm thinking of just iterating through all appropriate UI elements each frame and checking mouse position, seems like it would work fairly well. There was a good immediate-mode GUI article somewhere, C, that showed you how to do that.
2019-07-10 11:21:05	+carefish	i'm kinda ok w/ questions and stuff. but sometimes your questions feel way too much like a google hit away and imo it's one of the skills to learn to make learning programming easier overall
2019-07-10 11:21:21	yuken	I do know how to Google, I dunno why I keep asking in here.
2019-07-10 11:22:03	+carefish	also throw your shtuff on github
2019-07-10 11:22:12	+carefish	makes it far easier for us to poke at it
2019-07-10 11:22:17	yuken	fiiiine.
2019-07-10 11:23:04	yuken	... I should probably go write up a little design doc for this, otherwise it's gonna sprawl out of control fast.
2019-07-10 11:26:26	+carefish	yeah

2019-07-10 11:26:41	+carefish	so define what an alpha looks like, beta looks like, etc
2019-07-10 11:27:01	yuken	not just that, but how each system kinda talks to eachother. I don't wanna write it on the fly and the nhave to revamp it 9 times and then pull out entire systems.
2019-07-10 11:27:06	+carefish	and... 'fuck new features.' throw those on the 'nice to have' pile straight away
2019-07-10 11:27:14	yuken	I'm trying to go for extreme modularity here, basically.
2019-07-10 11:27:22	yuken	So most systems should be unreliant on others, except for the base system.
2019-07-10 11:27:23	+carefish	you'[re gonna need to do that anyways since you're learning
2019-07-10 11:27:40	+carefish	i'd go with making the game being more improtant than modularity
2019-07-10 11:28:00	+carefish	the skills you get while making the game will show you how to do it better 'later'
2019-07-10 11:28:14	yuken	I've made games before! Just never at scale :p
2019-07-10 11:29:31	+carefish	and never in rust before

2019-07-10 11:29:43	yuken	hey you shut up
2019-07-10 11:30:01	+carefish	so. focus on the game, not its modularity.
2019-07-10 11:30:18	+carefish	nice to think that way, but makey makey gamey gamey
2019-07-10 11:30:47	yuken	I just put pen on paper and holy crap, my handwriting is worse than doctor's chicken scratch
2019-07-10 11:30:51	yuken	I never lift my hand up... writing print.

2019-07-10 15:25:00	+Jattenalle	yuken, SDL2 itself doesnt let you batch, use OpenGL for that
2019-07-10 15:25:11	+Jattenalle	you can get an opengl context super easily by using SDL2 to setup your window
2019-07-10 15:25:36	+Jattenalle	it's a common use case: use SDL2 to create window and deal with OS crap, and use the context it gives you
2019-07-10 15:25:47	+Jattenalle	from then on you just use GL stuff, and dont touch SDL again
2019-07-10 15:26:35	+Jattenalle	all that said, if you enable double buffering, the GPU will be smart enough to batch.. even without double buffering it'll probably batch
2019-07-10 15:26:47	+Jattenalle	err, the driver*

2019-07-11 13:20:54	yuken	written in c, hence "c"
2019-07-11 13:21:09	yuken	you've probably seen it a lot, most self-hosted stuff that I know of uses it
2019-07-11 13:24:05	yuken	https://gist.github.com/YukenK/82650c301acb109fba901a5374e79ca3 is what my render/client code looks like carefish, 4% CPU use on a 4790k seems pretty acceptable for the general release client.
2019-07-11 13:24:26	yuken	and I can probably optimize it more by batching tiles if I want, like turning every 4x4 group of identical tiles into a single render copy instead, but that's more advanced stuff.
2019-07-11 13:27:55	+shan	yuken: what is set_viewport ?
2019-07-11 13:28:55	yuken	that... isn't obvious? it's setting the viewport.
2019-07-11 13:29:28	+shan	what provides it i mean
2019-07-11 13:29:32	+shan	did you write it yourself
2019-07-11 13:29:35	+shan	the function
2019-07-11 13:29:38	yuken	"window.canvas"
2019-07-11 13:29:59	+shan	and is that rust or go or what
2019-07-11 13:30:29	+shan	rust, it's rust
2019-07-11 13:31:08	+shan	mmm it has dynamic typing and does not require brackets in if statements
2019-07-11 13:31:11	+shan	i like this
2019-07-11 13:31:17	yuken	uh
2019-07-11 13:31:19	yuken	it has no dynamic typing
2019-07-11 13:33:19	+carefish	https://imgur.com/gallery/ak5w2bV
2019-07-11 13:34:29	+carefish	i don't see any advantage of self-hosted git for personal projects :P only when i deal with clients that have the requirement that data stays on-premise i deal with self-hosted git
2019-07-11 13:34:50	+carefish	otherwise, any of the git providers (github, bitbucket, gitlab) will work just fine
2019-07-11 13:36:14	+carefish	and even then, when it's self-hosted, i usually grab gitlab cause it is amazeballs. though it's not exactly a lean package

2019-07-12 11:10:29	+jonas__	I don't think that thing covers it, but I've also found carb-restricted diet like keto or atkins to be very effective

2019-07-12 11:11:15	+zebbiz_pi	sweet
2019-07-12 11:14:52	+bomb	that's actually a good long term plan. eat less, walk a bit and everything's gonna be alright
2019-07-12 11:15:00	+zebbiz_pi	yeah
2019-07-12 11:15:09	+zebbiz_pi	crash diets rarely work in the long term
2019-07-12 11:15:33	+bomb	now i have time, like 3 months of almost free time. i think i can go a bit further and work my ass off
2019-07-12 11:16:36	+jonas__	you gonna go for cardio or building muscle?
2019-07-12 11:16:52	+zebbiz_pi	Start with walking
2019-07-12 11:17:05	+zebbiz_pi	Small changes are easier to maintain
2019-07-12 11:17:06	yuken	no, don't do that. start running at full speed to every place you want to go
2019-07-12 11:17:11	yuken	run at full speed forever
2019-07-12 11:17:17	+zebbiz_pi	ninja run

2019-07-12 11:17:24	+bomb	cardio, i'm tired of being big already, not interested in muscles yet

2019-07-12 11:17:38	+bomb	dude i can't run outside that's embarrassing
2019-07-12 11:17:48	+zebbiz_pi	bomb: Building muscles helps with losing fat, fyi
2019-07-12 11:18:08	+bomb	right, but you can't build muscle when calorie deficit, no?
2019-07-12 11:18:21	+bomb	unless muscles build themselves using the body fat
2019-07-12 11:18:27	+zebbiz_pi	They do not
2019-07-12 11:18:50	+zebbiz_pi	But you will maintain muscle if you use them
2019-07-12 11:19:01	+bomb	i think lifting is good for burning the sugar in your body
2019-07-12 11:19:33	+bomb	right, exercising muscles is also a good way to tell your body not to burn proteins when it needs energy
2019-07-12 11:19:55	+bomb	are you 65 KG btw?
2019-07-12 11:20:19	+jonas__	I believe you can build muscle at a caloric deficit, but it's gonna be slower going
2019-07-12 11:21:09	+jonas__	remember that once you eat, there will be a temporary caloric surplus that can be used to build muscles for a bit..then the deficit comes back, which fat reserves will primarily be used to cover
2019-07-12 11:21:20	+jonas__	(or so I imagine it working, I'm not a doctor)
2019-07-12 11:21:31	+jonas__	obviously it's gonna be a lot harder though
2019-07-12 11:21:49	+zebbiz_pi	bomb: Me? I'm 60kg
2019-07-12 11:22:03	+jonas__	how many zebbiz_pi can you squat?
2019-07-12 11:23:47	+jonas__	fuck, I miss full body exercises :(  my feet have betrayed me by getting achy
2019-07-12 11:26:03	+bomb	injure is baaad
2019-07-12 11:28:43	+jonas__	yeah, it's okay now for the most part, except the occasional flare-up, but I have to avoid things like deadlifts and squats sadly
2019-07-12 11:36:44	elsie273	i suck at food control
2019-07-12 11:36:55	+zebbiz_pi	me too

2019-07-12 12:14:51	+carefish	awesome yuken @ posting it on github. also, i am unsure what you are doing that requires a constant vigilant eye on cpu usage. it's good to try to keep the usage and stuff down but it might be better to set 'limits' of performance for yourself and only start optimizing/making it better if you go over those
2019-07-12 12:15:25	+carefish	ie: under 20% cpu usage is fine. above 60 fps is fine, below is not ok
2019-07-12 12:15:30	+carefish	etc limits like those
2019-07-12 12:15:55	+carefish	rather than being irked whn your code goes from 2% to 8.something
2019-07-12 12:16:29	yuken	carefish, well, now it's at 25%.
2019-07-12 12:16:40	+carefish	that still sounds acceptable
2019-07-12 12:16:47	yuken	Not when I'm running a 4790k
2019-07-12 12:16:53	yuken	and people could be running this on a machine from 2006.
2019-07-12 12:16:54	+carefish	what's that proc
2019-07-12 12:16:56	+carefish	speed/etc
2019-07-12 12:17:02	yuken	4GHz Haswell.
2019-07-12 12:17:05	+carefish	sounds like a somewhat 'oldish' i7
2019-07-12 12:17:10	yuken	CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00GHz (1.90GHz)
2019-07-12 12:17:32	yuken	And it will only get worse, I'd imagine, as I add more stuff.
2019-07-12 12:17:33	+carefish	so did you test whether that 25% was on 4ghz or on 1.9ghz
2019-07-12 12:17:43	yuken	wot
2019-07-12 12:17:52	+carefish	throttling yo

2019-07-12 12:17:59	yuken	top will measure percentage in how much of a single CPU thread's time it's using, no?
2019-07-12 12:18:07	+carefish	if cpu doesn't need more hz's, it'll downclock
2019-07-12 12:18:15	yuken	yes I know that
2019-07-12 12:18:27	+carefish	i don't know how `top' registers those hz changes
2019-07-12 12:18:30	yuken	but top measures it in how much of the maximum cycles it can take from the CPU, I'm fairly sure.
2019-07-12 12:18:40	+carefish	but i sincerely doubt your game eats 25% of a 4ghz proc
2019-07-12 12:18:42	yuken	so 25% means it's using 25% of an entire core/thread's time.
2019-07-12 12:19:03	+carefish	still though
2019-07-12 12:19:10	+carefish	better get someone with a shitty machine to test
2019-07-12 12:19:36	+carefish	the only really big issue in your game, performance wise, would be the batching drawcalls thing
2019-07-12 12:19:36	yuken	I'm probably gonna try running it on my Raspberry Pi real quick or somethin
2019-07-12 12:19:58	+carefish	so unless that's not working, i seriously doubt any pc will have issues
2019-07-12 12:20:16	+carefish	maybe older machines if they are in areas with a few hundred clients, but even then its unlikely
2019-07-12 12:20:36	yuken	yeah, CPU use appears to be how much in % it is using fo the available cycles
2019-07-12 12:20:39	yuken	or something of that nature.

2019-07-15 12:20:17	elsie273	hbu?
2019-07-15 12:20:46	+carefish	umbraco... the cms?
2019-07-15 12:21:20	+carefish	i am trying to get my C# scripting to work w/ the super simplistic 2d opengl rendering thing i got going on
2019-07-15 12:22:13	+carefish	which does seem to be working pretty good
2019-07-15 12:22:35	elsie273	yes the cms

2019-07-15 12:23:06	elsie273	that's cool
2019-07-15 12:23:22	elsie273	i saw you mention hot reloading last night, what are you doing with that?
2019-07-15 12:24:12	+carefish	trying to make my own 'poke at it and see' framework
2019-07-15 12:24:26	+carefish	sometimes on the 'net i find interesting psuedo code/code not for C#
2019-07-15 12:24:42	+carefish	and i feel like 'dang, too bad i can't really test/try/fuck with that'
2019-07-15 12:24:49	+carefish	i know there's stuff like processing and p5.js
2019-07-15 12:24:58	+carefish	but those have their own issues which i really don't care for
2019-07-15 12:25:19	+carefish	once this thing is somewhat 'done', there's only one .exe and a scripts folder and boom presto you can draw shit
2019-07-15 12:25:45	+carefish	and to draw shit, just fire up the .exe and make your changes in the scripts, it'll get hotreloaded and such
2019-07-15 12:26:00	+carefish	and since it's compiled C#, there shouldn't be too many unexpected slowdowns
2019-07-15 12:26:16	+carefish	the 'unexpected' is important here
2019-07-15 12:26:39	+carefish	probably/hopefully later today i have the first version working
2019-07-15 12:26:54	+carefish	merging my opentk/opengl adventures with this guy
2019-07-15 12:27:27	+carefish	then you should be able to have an entry point (probably gonna use main for that, as is convention)
2019-07-15 12:27:45	+carefish	and from there on, just draw sprites by 'new'ing them and not give a single shit how they're rendered
2019-07-15 12:28:21	+carefish	just deal with loading in a nice looking texture (var spr = new Sprite("path") and do stuff with the sprite (spr.Rotation += angle, for example)
2019-07-15 12:28:52	+carefish	and last night i reduced the memory usage w/ approx 60mb
2019-07-15 12:29:11	+carefish	so now the memory usage of this app is still on the high side, but who cares. prototype away! huehue

2019-07-15 12:31:08	+carefish	so in the end: main.cs (filename doesn't matter, need a 'main' entry point.) and a start/init function to grab your resources
2019-07-15 12:31:21	+carefish	and a simple update() that's gonna be at the FPS you request it to be at
2019-07-15 12:33:31	+carefish	and once that works fine and dandy through C#
2019-07-15 12:33:37	+carefish	i think i'll add javascript too
2019-07-15 12:33:42	+carefish	just for luls
2019-07-15 12:34:09	+carefish	and want to know how you could code it so you can call javascript from the scripted C# side and vice versa
2019-07-15 12:55:54	yuken	hmmm
2019-07-15 12:56:25	yuken	I need to figure out how I'm going to keep track of _where_ my mobs/clients are.
2019-07-15 12:56:52	yuken	So server receives an input from client #1, how the hell does the server know where the client is in the world, if it's constnatly being shared between threads?
2019-07-15 12:57:44	+carefish	?
2019-07-15 12:57:58	+carefish	the position of the client (a player) is always known though
2019-07-15 12:58:43	yuken	Unless
2019-07-15 12:58:58	yuken	I just store all clients in the network thread, and have them point to the mob they're associated with instead.
2019-07-15 12:59:52	+carefish	let's redefine mob to something i hear more often
2019-07-15 13:00:02	+carefish	'npc'
2019-07-15 13:00:10	yuken	Mob in this case is the object associated with a player or movable entity that isn't an item.
2019-07-15 13:00:21	yuken	They have Stats, they are Damageable, Renderable and Movable.
2019-07-15 13:01:13	+carefish	so it's basically a pickup?
2019-07-15 13:01:23	yuken	wut?
2019-07-15 13:02:11	+carefish	item that can be picked up by players, but also left on the ground as a movable entity
2019-07-15 13:02:38	yuken	No. They aren't items.
2019-07-15 13:03:07	yuken	A Mob just refers to any movable, damageable, stats-having, renderable entity.
2019-07-15 13:03:23	+carefish	so it's an entity?
2019-07-15 13:03:25	yuken	Yes.
2019-07-15 13:04:30	yuken	A client can switch mobs during gameplay, but a client must always have a mob associated with it. NPCs are also mobs.
2019-07-15 13:05:24	+carefish	i still think with references this may have been easier to solve
2019-07-15 13:05:48	yuken	Mobs will be constantly moving around in memory, carefish.
2019-07-15 13:05:49	+carefish	right now it sounds like you need to figure out some way to send messages between threads reliably
2019-07-15 13:05:58	yuken	So a reference wouldn't work.
2019-07-15 13:06:05	+carefish	sure they would
2019-07-15 13:06:26	+carefish	i pass reference to object, object changes whatever the reference points to but doesn't change where it points to
2019-07-15 13:06:58	yuken	wat
2019-07-15 13:07:01	yuken	I'm 99% sure that wouldn't work.
2019-07-15 13:09:51	yuken	unless you flipped some words there and meant that the reference would be set to point to the correct spot?
2019-07-15 13:11:09	+carefish	the memory address the reference points to shouldn't ever change though
2019-07-15 13:11:20	+carefish	unless you're destroying that reference and new'ing something else on top of it
2019-07-15 13:11:48	yuken	... actually, if I'm using Rc, that's right. I was thinking because I'm always moving my mobs/etc between threads and vectors, that they would change locations
2019-07-15 13:11:58	yuken	but if all I'm doing is moving the _pointers_ around, that doesn't change anything
2019-07-15 13:12:39	+carefish	https://ideone.com/iErEBq
2019-07-15 13:13:15	yuken	yeah carefish, for a second I thought I was still actually moving my mobs around, and not just pointers to them.
2019-07-15 13:13:20	yuken	So that would work.
2019-07-15 13:13:48	+carefish	moving any memory around should be avoided if you can
2019-07-15 13:13:52	yuken	I'll need to abstract all my interactions with my mobs/items/etc though, so they're properly locked and unlocked whenever.
2019-07-15 13:14:07	yuken	but outside of that, it shouldn't be too hard. I just need to get inter-threaded communications up I guess.
2019-07-15 13:14:08	+carefish	unless it's to put data closer to eachother in memory for that 'data localization' stuff, but that's next level CS stuff
2019-07-15 13:15:51	yuken	egh, maybe I won't even thread this, because that's getting a bit complicated.
2019-07-15 13:17:14	yuken	If I want to thread this, I might need a damn event queue too, so I don't miss any events.
2019-07-15 13:17:38	+carefish	how about this
2019-07-15 13:17:49	+carefish	first game the networking work flawlessly the way you want it
2019-07-15 13:17:55	+carefish	then start to improve it with threading
2019-07-15 13:18:10	yuken	Well, that isn't the problem that I was thinking of, carefish.
2019-07-15 13:18:13	+carefish	because threaded networking is a recipe to grow grey hairs well before its your time to do so
2019-07-15 13:18:34	yuken	I was thinking of locking/unlocking issues and, say, the client needing to do something to the mob at the same time as the mob is being used by another thread.
2019-07-15 13:18:54	+carefish	of those of those actions are 'writes'
2019-07-15 13:19:04	+carefish	then you're shit outta luck and they'll have to wait for eachother
2019-07-15 13:19:27	yuken	yeah, I may just... ignore threading completely. That's already a bit too complex.
2019-07-15 13:20:18	+carefish	nah, threading is good to understand
2019-07-15 13:20:42	yuken	basically, "oh no I can't access this thing, guess I need to queue up this event for when I can..."
2019-07-15 13:20:53	yuken	and that's already gonna be a pain to deal with, even in Rust.
2019-07-15 13:21:01	+carefish	but the parts that make it super hard to understand is that it requires most code to allow for multithreading which is kinda hard to wrap your head around... if you don't even know 'what' your app really is going to be
2019-07-15 13:21:07	yuken	The only threading Iv'e worked with before were where the threads did not need to speak to one another.
2019-07-15 13:22:29	+carefish	well, the easiest way to do communication between threads, imo, is very similar to the CQRS pattern
2019-07-15 13:23:00	yuken	maybe I'll just rewrite everything in an ECS-style and write up a proper event queue for all my stuff
2019-07-15 13:23:15	+carefish	threads send Commands or Queries to their respective handlers. which then have a means to deal with those commands/queries
2019-07-15 13:23:48	+carefish	like a message bus type thing
2019-07-15 13:29:03	yuken	oh, discord egirl killed by her discord eboy
2019-07-15 13:47:28	+carefish	https://ideone.com/M6aH5u yuken
2019-07-15 13:48:15	+carefish	this is the CQRS pattern simplified
2019-07-15 13:48:33	yuken	carefish, maybe I'll rewrite my stuff to fit that pattern, then.
2019-07-15 13:48:53	+carefish	it will allow you to send messages like commands or queries
2019-07-15 13:49:00	+carefish	and then have the handler take care of those
2019-07-15 13:49:19	yuken	And, I might switch over to a better pattern than... what I have now, to say the least.
2019-07-15 13:49:41	yuken	https://github.com/YukenK/infinity/blob/master/src/mob.rs is what my stuff looks like r/n and it's pretty mediocre
2019-07-15 13:49:42	+carefish	semantic difference Query and Command make it SUPER easy to debug your problems later on
2019-07-15 13:49:59	+carefish	especially if you ensure that only commands can do writes
2019-07-15 13:50:27	+carefish	don't dismiss your code dude
2019-07-15 13:50:30	+carefish	keep going
2019-07-15 13:50:36	+carefish	you're learning, figuring things out, etc
2019-07-15 13:51:15	+carefish	there is one feature i don't have time to show/code a sample for with CQRS yuken
2019-07-15 13:51:40	yuken	ye but look at that
2019-07-15 13:51:45	+carefish	but the idea is that you 'inject' a handler into a, in your case a mob, and that the mob's handler takes care of all commands/queries that were meant for that mob
2019-07-15 13:51:48	yuken	it just seems mediocre, not using components to build an object.
2019-07-15 13:51:52	+carefish	who cares
2019-07-15 13:51:54	+carefish	seriously
2019-07-15 13:52:00	+carefish	when you're learning things
2019-07-15 13:52:05	+carefish	don't worry too much about cleanliness
2019-07-15 13:52:15	+carefish	it's all gonna have some code smell sooner or later
2019-07-15 13:53:39	+carefish	code seems fine to me
2019-07-15 13:53:51	+carefish	doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to use components for now
2019-07-15 13:54:05	+carefish	because afaik, there aren't many components for you to build your mobs from yet
2019-07-15 13:55:19	+carefish	also, rust is hard-mode for what you're doing. it's okay to shortcut your way to comprehension

2019-07-15 14:24:20	--	h is now known as Hzar
2019-07-15 14:29:46	+Waynes	CQRS is just shitty function calls
2019-07-15 14:47:53	yuken	carefish, so I'll need an event queue for all my threads, and something which handles those events properly. hm
2019-07-15 14:56:05	+carefish	well... the event queue is already in that list inside the handler
2019-07-15 14:56:31	+carefish	soo i guess you'll have to make sure the handler synchronizes read/writes properly between commands/queries
2019-07-15 14:57:43	yuken	It's just a lot more difficult of an idea to have that, especially because I need to make... basically nothing timing-dependent, use plenty of callbacks, whatnot.
2019-07-15 14:59:57	+carefish	protip: timing dependency code stinks, unless in well controlled environments
2019-07-15 15:00:42	yuken	guess later today I'm gonna take pen on paper and write up a thing on how I'm gonna do that
2019-07-15 15:00:47	yuken	a little diagram on how it all works.
2019-07-15 15:04:23	+carefish	yerp
2019-07-15 15:04:25	+carefish	always good idea
2019-07-15 15:05:53	yuken	Right now the basic idea is: every thread has an event/command handler, which is the only way to talk between threads. I have an Event struct, which is what I'll use to send events, and then... figure it out from there
2019-07-15 15:06:13	+carefish	google for this stuff dude
2019-07-15 15:06:26	+carefish	you are not trying to solve this for the first time, many went before you
2019-07-15 15:06:27	yuken	I have been Googling!
2019-07-15 15:06:33	+carefish	it's good to read other peoples code and approaches
2019-07-15 15:07:06	+carefish	https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-02-message-passing.html
2019-07-15 15:07:24	+carefish	looks like that will do precisely what you need
2019-07-15 15:07:37	yuken	channels are annoying when you have 10-20 different threads
2019-07-15 15:07:38	+DrAwesomeCraws	just use perl instead
2019-07-15 15:07:52	yuken	and then you need a shit-load of receivers and senders, keeping track of those...
2019-07-15 15:08:01	yuken	because each sender can only send to its receiver, not a random receiver.
2019-07-15 15:08:38	+carefish	and now you know why certain programming fields are paid much more than others.
2019-07-15 15:10:06	yuken	Rust has Mutexes,  which will... probably be how I handle it,  maybe.
2019-07-15 15:10:38	+carefish	so a receiver endpoint could be the actual message bus
2019-07-15 15:10:54	+carefish	so that all your objects send to that message bus, and the message bus sends it to its destination
2019-07-15 15:11:01	yuken	actually carefish, https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam-channel
2019-07-15 15:11:19	yuken	There is a very popular Rust lib, crossbeam, that does this.
2019-07-15 15:11:30	yuken	Maybe.
2019-07-15 15:12:16	+carefish	definitely go for it
2019-07-15 15:12:27	yuken	I dunno if that does exactly what I need, but it might help.
2019-07-15 15:12:28	+carefish	the built-in one is shortname for multiple producer single consumer
2019-07-15 15:12:35	yuken	I know that :p
2019-07-15 15:12:39	+carefish	so to fork mutli consumers in there on your own is gonna be hard
2019-07-15 15:12:53	+carefish	so that crossbeam looks like what you wanna use
2019-07-15 15:13:56	yuken	Okay, https://docs.rs/crossbeam/0.7.1/crossbeam/channel/index.html looks pretty simple nad nice.
2019-07-15 15:14:13	yuken	Zero-capacity channels means that they block until received/sent, then you have channels with capacity, then infinite capacity channels.

2019-07-15 15:20:35	+carefish	the other one is so you have your own knowledge base at the ready for when you feel adventurous enough to try and lift that prototype code into something real
2019-07-15 15:20:49	+carefish	and potentially have caught some nice edge cases and whatnot
2019-07-15 15:21:12	yuken	well, that's what I normally do for testing stuff, recreate it in a new environment.
2019-07-15 15:22:02	yuken	I'm not sure if it's even worse it to try and thread this, it was originally just an idea.
2019-07-15 15:23:14	+carefish	well these tests go further than just tests y'know
2019-07-15 15:23:18	yuken	Threading would be good if I wanted to run it on a super low-end device though, like a Raspberry Pi as a game server.
2019-07-15 15:23:26	+carefish	if it's like those ideone samples i sent you, then yes. those are just 'tests'
2019-07-15 15:23:43	+carefish	what i really mean here is: setup your networking threading thing, let that communicate between client and server
2019-07-15 15:23:51	+carefish	make sure that that runs as you want it to run
2019-07-15 15:23:54	yuken	There is no server yet.
2019-07-15 15:24:00	+carefish	and THEN test messaging across threads
2019-07-15 15:24:10	+carefish	oh, the udp listener thing you threw out?
2019-07-15 15:24:22	yuken	That was a test.
2019-07-15 15:24:31	+carefish	well, grab that again
2019-07-15 15:24:47	+carefish	do some messaging between your network thread and main thread
2019-07-15 15:24:55	+carefish	get the hang of using that crossbream library
2019-07-15 15:25:04	+carefish	really doesn't matter much what that messaging is
2019-07-15 15:25:25	+carefish	but you need to write with that library in that udp sample you made so you can have a better view on how to proceed with your drawn diagrams
2019-07-15 15:25:57	+carefish	i still think you should use threading to the fucking max, it's a sure fire way to get very intimate with rust
2019-07-15 15:26:24	yuken	fiiine, at least it would allow it to run on slow but multi-core devices like a Pi.
2019-07-15 15:26:41	+carefish	yes.
2019-07-15 15:26:47	+carefish	you're gonna thank yourself later
2019-07-15 15:26:58	+carefish	some of these programming things.. they 'look' hard
2019-07-15 15:27:15	+carefish	which is because they are hard, but once you get into them they are way more managable than many people think
2019-07-15 15:27:22	Hzar	Well threading is easy to do wrong
2019-07-15 15:27:54	+carefish	very easy to do wrong yeah
2019-07-15 15:27:54	yuken	How do I handle my event loop with an event queue? Like, 60/120/240/3000000 times per second, I loop over all entities that are supposed to have "ticks", and do all appropriate stuff on them.
2019-07-15 15:27:54	yuken	DO I just have those as events too, and push them into the queue, and then after that, loop over the queue?
2019-07-15 15:27:57	+carefish	just loop over it as fast as possible

2019-07-15 15:34:54	+carefish	done
2019-07-15 15:35:01	yuken	wat
2019-07-15 15:35:23	Hzar	im guessing this code is going to be slower than if it was single threaded
2019-07-15 15:36:01	yuken	It probably is, Hzar.
2019-07-15 15:36:08	+carefish	similar things go for your mobs and such
2019-07-15 15:36:23	+carefish	struct mob { eventid, threadid }
2019-07-15 15:36:29	yuken	I genuinely don't think that having an Event like that would ever work, carefish, in Rust.
2019-07-15 15:36:40	+carefish	i don't know rust
2019-07-15 15:36:40	yuken	I can't leave struct members null, and there are way too many different possibilities that I might want.
2019-07-15 15:37:07	+carefish	i'm sure you can assign -1 or 0 on them though
2019-07-15 15:37:55	Hzar	assuming they are references(never done rust): just make a reference to a generic thing that does nothing?
2019-07-15 15:38:14	+carefish	i've been telling yuken to use references everywhere you can
2019-07-15 15:38:19	yuken	Can't use references.
2019-07-15 15:38:25	yuken	This ain't C.
2019-07-15 15:38:29	+carefish	that would solve a lot of his questions relating to 'who owns what'

2019-07-15 15:39:02	+carefish	which you will have to, the moment you involve threading
2019-07-15 15:39:05	+carefish	or networking
2019-07-15 15:40:12	Hzar	whats a reference/const non null pointer called in rust then?
2019-07-15 15:40:25	yuken	Rc.
2019-07-15 15:40:30	Hzar	an rc?
2019-07-15 15:40:50	Hzar	rc stands for?
2019-07-15 15:42:40	Hzar	reference counted pointer
2019-07-15 15:52:13	+carefish	so...
2019-07-15 15:52:33	+carefish	let mut myReference = &someObjet; won't do the trick yuken?
2019-07-15 15:52:57	+carefish	i get that that might throw compile time errors if those refs can't be determined
2019-07-15 15:53:05	yuken	no, carefish
2019-07-15 15:53:19	yuken	Rust enforces lifetimes on borrows.

2019-07-15 16:34:05	yuken	that sounds horrific carefish
2019-07-15 16:34:38	+carefish	it is
2019-07-15 16:34:48	+carefish	but it's for a prototyping framework so meh

2019-07-15 16:35:54	+carefish	which is going nicely, and once i figure out how to disallow certain namespaces from being used/called from the scripting side i can post some build sof this to mess around with
2019-07-15 16:36:33	+carefish	main goal of this prototyping tool: ability to draw simple sprites and text, as well as direct opengl access if the user wants it
2019-07-15 16:37:52	+carefish	how to use it?
2019-07-15 16:38:55	+carefish	either get .net core runtime, clone the repo, open folder in vscode w/ the appropriate C# extensions to get debug abilities for your compiled scripts or if you don't want to use that feature... just start writing
2019-07-15 16:39:09	+carefish	or download a build, and start messing with the provided sample scripts right away
2019-07-15 16:39:40	+Jattenalle	nicely done carefish, hotloading dll's is the shit when developing
2019-07-15 16:40:06	+carefish	in the latter case it's probably a good idea to use an editor that has syntax highlighting... until i figure out how to get vscode to also run from the build+scripts thing for debugging
2019-07-15 16:40:45	+carefish	i hope to give a sample build for anyone interested later today
2019-07-15 16:41:23	+carefish	win-x64 or mac builds i can do, not sure if i can easily provide generic linux builds

2019-07-15 16:41:57	+carefish	so now i can have my own 'serverless' functions
2019-07-15 16:43:20	+carefish	current strategy for disallowing namespaces is super naive but seems to work pretty well, i wonder how well it holds up once the scripts folder start to actuall be somewhat big
2019-07-15 16:44:07	yuken	why not just allow OS/System namespace carefish? ez pz
2019-07-15 16:44:11	yuken	let users write and read all files.
2019-07-15 16:44:34	+carefish	that was my first thought as well
2019-07-15 16:44:52	+carefish	don't care about it and such, let the user deal with it
2019-07-15 16:45:13	+carefish	i do think that that is a very bad idea overall, since it's super easy to write portable nastiness with this now

2019-07-15 17:26:20	+carefish	some libraries really do not want ot provide binaries 'because someone could mess with them'
2019-07-15 17:27:15	+carefish	which is kinda frustrating, cause then you either have to reference the project hat builds your binaries or compile them yourself somehow
2019-07-15 17:27:30	+carefish	and oof. that stuff almost never goes off flawlessly on windows
2019-07-15 17:27:50	+carefish	so i hope that conan might fix that for me and bring back some of the joy of C++ coding :p
2019-07-15 17:27:57	n0tus	it did for me
2019-07-15 17:28:27	+carefish	right now i am super hyped by .net core
2019-07-15 17:28:36	n0tus	the elm package manager is also pretty cool, it automatically enforces semantic versioning
2019-07-15 17:28:39	+carefish	some things are so much better than the 'old' .net framework
2019-07-15 17:29:47	+carefish	oh that's also quite nice
2019-07-15 17:30:10	+carefish	so you're kinda sure to be ok with moving between x.x.y-z ?
2019-07-15 17:30:17	+carefish	and stuff won't break
2019-07-15 17:30:27	+carefish	the hwole err. major/minor/patch thing
2019-07-15 17:31:01	n0tus	yeah, does some interesting type system analysis to acheive it

2019-07-15 17:35:38	+carefish	you'd still need a way to connect to it automatically via vscode or something
2019-07-15 17:35:55	+carefish	oh well, first get my other stuff working
2019-07-15 17:36:06	+carefish	debugging on the script side w/o the .net runtime installed would be nice

2019-07-16 12:50:17	+carefish	the thing that i find super annoying with opengl so far
2019-07-16 12:50:29	+carefish	there's no 'right way' to do stuff it seems?
2019-07-16 12:51:09	+carefish	i see so many approaches with practically the same end result (although some where really naive implementations like sending seperate quads/verts per 2d sprite vs. one implmenetation that sends all of them an bam
2019-07-16 12:51:34	+carefish	so i guess... i can do whatever i feel like, but that doesn't give me a comfortable solid footing ;/

2019-07-16 16:30:06	n0tus	carefish: you're correct in that there is no right way, but some ways are better than others,  opengl tutorials are good to get started but you might have to look at the architecture of other people's renderers to get a good feel as to what you want your end result to be
2019-07-16 16:31:24	n0tus	carefish: this is worth checking out if you havent https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki
2019-07-16 16:32:29	+carefish	is this from the same guy that made tinywindow
2019-07-16 16:32:56	+carefish	doesn't appear to be
2019-07-16 16:33:21	+carefish	but i'll do that yeah, i've been keeping a few sources and tutorials side by side to note their differences and what makes them different
2019-07-16 16:33:40	+carefish	https://github.com/ziacko/TinyWindow this guy
2019-07-16 16:35:34	yuken	carefish, I have this... "thing" so far. https://gist.github.com/YukenK/b99b633565f9b52616bfd95817cf8959
2019-07-16 16:36:13	n0tus	tiny renderer is more of a teaching tool meant to teach you how to do graphics programming with no libraries at all (well one for model loading I think), the idea is that by having people do everything by hand they can make better decisions with opengl, you code out all the drawing functions and everything
2019-07-16 16:37:08	n0tus	he has the same for a raycaster, raytracer, and ray marching
2019-07-16 16:37:09	+carefish	i'll go through the motions
2019-07-16 16:37:23	--	Guest37306 is now known as Hzar
2019-07-16 16:38:31	Hzar	Do many people do graphics without a game engine et al these days?
2019-07-16 16:39:14	+carefish	idk
2019-07-16 16:39:38	n0tus	sure but you usually do graphics with a renderer, a well made game engine will not care about the renderer
2019-07-16 16:39:44	+carefish	i just want to know more after using game engines for a long time
2019-07-16 16:40:27	Hzar	well theres modelviewprojection matrix, some shaders with normals, specular etc
2019-07-16 16:40:41	Hzar	that would take a few weeks to code from scratch
2019-07-16 16:40:51	n0tus	as in a well made game engine should have decoupling between the renderer and the rest of the engine so you can swap them out
2019-07-16 16:41:04	+carefish	i wanna interface with opengl and 2d only for now
2019-07-16 16:41:07	n0tus	yah some people like making games and some people like making engines
2019-07-16 16:41:13	n0tus	this crowd is mostly the latter
2019-07-16 16:41:58	+carefish	i already saw some 3d stuff and that's awesome to know but i fear it'll distract me way too much from what i want right now: a basic understanding of opengl so i can move on with confidence and not code with fingers crossed when i poke at it
2019-07-16 16:42:09	+carefish	i prefer making games tbh
2019-07-16 16:42:20	Hzar	engines is fun
2019-07-16 16:42:22	n0tus	the /r/SAT subreddit got banned last night, they reopened this morning, apparently its cause they share tests in the sub
2019-07-16 16:42:31	Hzar	but then you end up spending 2 weeks making the same thing that you can setup in 20 mins with some engine
2019-07-16 16:42:37	+carefish	i have an idea, but i wanna muck ahead with this prototype thing and then actually use it for that idea
2019-07-16 16:43:12	n0tus	its not really about the time it takes Hzar, at least for people who want to make engines, its more about the learning experience, understanding everything from top to bottom
2019-07-16 16:43:18	+carefish	so far it took me 2 days to get planes and cubes rotating/moving around... and understand what i am doing
2019-07-16 16:43:30	Hzar	2 days sounds pretty speedy honestly
2019-07-16 16:43:37	+carefish	now i am trying to read those sources to actually hide away a lot of drawing code for the scripting side
2019-07-16 16:44:44	+carefish	in the end i want to be able to instantiate a new Sprite in an init function, and then be able to move that thing around in a simple update function
2019-07-16 16:45:13	+carefish	var spr = new Sprite(); //in update(float dt): spr.x += wahtever;
2019-07-16 16:45:54	+carefish	so thanks for those links n0tus
2019-07-16 16:46:10	+carefish	i think once i got this to work using those vertex arrays, i'll look into vulkan
2019-07-16 16:46:19	+carefish	i 'think' by that time i understand way more what vulkan wants from me
2019-07-16 16:46:46	+carefish	again, future business. once the sprite stuff works i intend to make a few prototypes to see where i need to add more
2019-07-16 16:47:05	Hzar	shaders
2019-07-16 16:48:34	+carefish	having a lot of fun with making C# my scripting domain
2019-07-16 16:48:51	Hzar	like a website?
2019-07-16 16:48:55	+carefish	cause i've already been using it to test stuff, then literally copy/pasting it into the actual project when it works well enough
2019-07-16 16:49:30	Hzar	eh i cant read it seems
2019-07-16 16:49:38	+carefish	no, these last few days i have been working on a pet project of mine, the ability to quickly create prototypes with C# without needing an engine or a .net runtime
2019-07-16 16:50:00	+carefish	the latter part works pretty good so far
2019-07-16 16:50:11	+carefish	that was the hotreloading thing i was working on y'day
2019-07-16 16:50:25	n0tus	do u pet ur pet project
2019-07-16 16:50:30	Hzar	isn't there classloaders in mono or .net or whatever C# runs on?
2019-07-16 16:50:43	+carefish	the single file executable is ginormous, like 95mb, but it works on at least 4 different machines that i could test (1 linux, 1 mac, 2 windows)
2019-07-16 16:50:56	Hzar	hotloading in jvm is definitely a thing
2019-07-16 16:51:03	+carefish	yeah, i had to do it myself
2019-07-16 16:51:18	+carefish	because what i'm doing is recompiling the C# into an assembly
2019-07-16 16:51:22	+carefish	it's not interpreted
2019-07-16 16:51:31	Hzar	How do you handle the memory?
2019-07-16 16:51:49	+carefish	unload the context and load the new context on demand
2019-07-16 16:52:24	Hzar	hmm
2019-07-16 16:52:29	+carefish	so far, memory usage is within reason. approx the same size as the binary itself, a tiny bit bigger: 105mb
2019-07-16 16:52:30	Hzar	sounds like a hard problem
2019-07-16 16:52:42	+carefish	even if you spam ctrl-s on a script file
2019-07-16 16:52:47	+carefish	at most it grows to 165mb
2019-07-16 16:52:56	+carefish	and slinks down pretty soon after
2019-07-16 16:54:02	+carefish	also, i'm referencing the entire .net standard 3.0 thing (i 'could' target 2.0... but nope. i want to use IAsyncEnumerable and IAsyncDisposable
2019-07-16 16:54:37	n0tus	i was watching some video of fisherman off the coast having their boat dragged around by a great white shark and in the video they censored the swearing and fisherman swear so much it was just one long continuous censor tone
2019-07-16 16:54:47	+carefish	lmao
2019-07-16 16:55:08	+carefish	anyway, once i get that sprite stuff working, mind trying to break it n0tus ?
2019-07-16 16:55:55	+carefish	or anyone for that matter
2019-07-16 16:56:07	Hzar	you guys ever done anything with surface nets?
2019-07-16 16:56:15	+carefish	idk what surface nets are
2019-07-16 16:56:32	Hzar	like minecraft style voxels but you move the corners around
2019-07-16 16:56:38	+carefish	oh
2019-07-16 16:56:43	+carefish	like lengyel thing?
2019-07-16 16:57:17	Hzar	similar yes
2019-07-16 16:57:20	Hzar	he uses dual contouring
2019-07-16 16:57:37	Hzar	which stores more data on each voxel, but I assume is better than surface nets (though I havn't figured out why yet...)
2019-07-16 16:59:13	Hzar	or wait
2019-07-16 17:00:56	Hzar	this looks like its marching cubes with LOD

2019-07-16 17:06:20	+carefish	hmm
2019-07-16 17:06:36	+carefish	i think i'll expose Sprite as a thing to derive from, to use through composition
2019-07-16 17:08:52	+carefish	i'm curious if i should allow users to decide themselves how to update or provide them an overridable method, and if they call base.Update() it'll get updated using the internal mechanism or if they don't they can use their own mechanism
2019-07-16 17:09:14	+carefish	oh well, fek it. food time
2019-07-16 17:10:53	+carefish	i kinda liked unity's approach in this
2019-07-16 17:11:06	+carefish	if you want to use the provided things, inherit from monobehaviour
2019-07-16 17:11:17	+carefish	if you don't, well.. just have one inherit from it and kick off from there
2019-07-16 17:14:29	+carefish	or tell unity to use a specific startup file and go from there

2019-07-23 12:04:51	+shan	YOOO BITCHES
2019-07-23 12:05:05	+shan	I implemented the map format for my game, and an editor for it
2019-07-23 12:05:19	+carefish	good job
2019-07-23 12:05:51	+carefish	good mornin' folks
2019-07-23 12:06:01	+shan	i mean, there's still some work left on the editor, but i can see my way clear to it
2019-07-23 12:07:19	+carefish	shan: if you are unsure if you should load all your assets, i think this question might answer it: 'can i still upload this to facebook instant games?' (regardless if you wanna target that or not)
2019-07-23 12:07:33	+carefish	if the answer is still yes, i'm sure loading all assets at once is fine
2019-07-23 12:07:48	+carefish	iirc thre's a 30mb limit on fb instant(?)
2019-07-23 12:08:48	+shan	i believe i will load all of them at once, except for music
2019-07-23 12:09:03	+carefish	how many mb's of assets are we talking about
2019-07-23 12:09:28	+carefish	because music doesn't have to be loaded, it can be streamed
2019-07-23 12:09:46	+carefish	but again, concrete numbers give concrete advice
2019-07-23 12:10:08	+carefish	sub 30mb? don't worry too much about it. you should let your players know though.
2019-07-23 12:10:23	+shan	carefish: i doubt that the script (the word scripts) and art assets combined are going to be > 30mb
2019-07-23 12:10:32	+carefish	if the game is sub 5mb, let them know that it won't take too long anymore
2019-07-23 12:11:18	+carefish	cause if you let them download 2mb, and it 'feels' like its too long for them... you just lost players
2019-07-23 12:12:56	+shan	so, like, a loading screen?
2019-07-23 12:13:49	+carefish	yeah
2019-07-23 12:13:51	+carefish	anythign
2019-07-23 12:14:05	+carefish	another good one: download larger assets in the background
2019-07-23 12:14:14	+carefish	but still let the players know
2019-07-23 12:14:41	+carefish	"yoooo main game is in! you can play while we fish in the rest of the game"
2019-07-23 12:15:59	+shan	ok
2019-07-23 12:16:15	+shan	i mean, it's a localhost thing, so i shouldn't have trouble
2019-07-23 12:20:28	+carefish	oh
2019-07-23 12:20:32	+carefish	i thought you were gonna host it somewhere
2019-07-23 12:20:44	+carefish	if you are gonna put it in electron, all you do need is a loading bar somewhere
2019-07-23 12:20:48	+shan	yeah
2019-07-23 12:21:01	+shan	it probably won't be electron
2019-07-23 12:21:09	+shan	i'd like to use something that uses gecko

2019-07-23 16:53:31	+carefish	tbh its syntax doesn't look too bad
2019-07-23 16:53:55	+carefish	it very much looks like an improvement of python ?
2019-07-23 16:54:03	+Waynes	everything that can be compiled to C can possibly be made to run on any platform
2019-07-23 16:54:09	+carefish	i don't remember exactly when the last time i saw nim... i think it was 6? years ago
2019-07-23 16:56:30	yuken	nim is actually a pretty decent language from what I know - runs on anything because it's just C, can even be used to write an operating system.
2019-07-23 16:56:40	yuken	And high performance.
2019-07-23 16:57:03	+Waynes	it has some weird quirks like "style insensitivity", i.e. you can call fooBar as foo_bar and vice versa
2019-07-23 16:57:31	+carefish	i just saw an example which blew my mind
2019-07-23 16:57:58	+carefish	https://nim-lang.org/features.html scroll down to 'small core with a rich prospect for extensibility'
2019-07-23 16:58:17	+carefish	that code sample on the right, that's stupid programming fun you can do with that
2019-07-23 16:58:52	+carefish	making whatever string value is in the variable a strongly typed data type
2019-07-23 16:58:59	+carefish	pretty nifty.
2019-07-23 16:59:58	yuken	nim was actually going to be my second choice after Rust, but I chose Rust cuz idk.
2019-07-23 17:00:07	+carefish	especially since you can see how they achieve that with the nnenmty/newemptynode calls

2019-07-23 17:20:14	+carefish	this feels like a redundant question, but i'm gonna ask it anyways: if i only want 2d sprites, it is smarter to use gl quads so i can draw even more sprites vs the 2 triangle setup?
2019-07-23 17:20:56	+carefish	cause i kinda am leaning towards leaving all of the opengl code only deal with triangles so it's easier to read overall
2019-07-23 17:21:33	+Waynes	quads are deprecated anyway
2019-07-23 17:21:58	+Waynes	so I'd go with triangles everywhere
2019-07-23 17:22:49	+carefish	i do believe i might support it later down the road once i have 3d models to work though
2019-07-23 17:23:05	+carefish	because i do think it might be a good idea to use quads when i make user interfaces with it
2019-07-23 17:23:40	+Waynes	just wrap it so it emits two triangles
2019-07-23 17:24:07	+carefish	that's what all my sprites are now
2019-07-23 17:24:24	+carefish	reading up on those projection matrices and stuff to learn how to move them around
2019-07-23 17:24:43	+carefish	some of it is easy, but never really touched matrices before
2019-07-23 17:26:27	yuken	carefish, aren't gl quads just 2 triangles, but handled for you nicer?
2019-07-23 17:26:35	yuken	that's how SFML's quads were ,at least.
2019-07-23 17:26:40	yuken	(and SFML used OpenGL)
2019-07-23 17:27:02	+carefish	afaik when you specify GLQuads your vertice array needs to contain quads
2019-07-23 17:27:40	yuken	well yeah, but it's just an abstraction from triangles, no? Rather than specifying 2 triangles with the vertices to make a rectangle, you specify 4 points for a quad.
2019-07-23 17:27:52	+carefish	i don't know
2019-07-23 17:27:54	+carefish	hence the question
2019-07-23 17:28:45	+carefish	so a quad vertice array will be smaller in memory than a triangle array yuken
2019-07-23 17:29:02	+carefish	that was semi-why i wondered if it actually works the way it think it does
2019-07-23 17:29:12	yuken	hm, looks like quad is a separate primitive, deprecated since OpenGL 3.0
2019-07-23 17:29:14	yuken	and removed since 3.1

2019-07-23 17:29:26	+carefish	well i'm at 4+
2019-07-23 17:29:32	yuken	but appears to still be 2 triangles in most implementations
2019-07-23 17:29:34	+carefish	so guess i don't have to worry about any of this
2019-07-23 17:29:39	yuken	but GPU vendors can do whatever they want.
2019-07-23 17:29:48	+carefish	then it stays triangles
