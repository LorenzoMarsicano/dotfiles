2019-10-17 11:25:50	yuken	Alright so
2019-10-17 11:25:56	yuken	I legitimately have no clue how _scrolling_ works for GUIs.
2019-10-17 11:26:59	+zebbiz_pi	You use the scroll wheel
2019-10-17 11:27:46	yuken	yes ya dummy but how are they implemented? the only way I can reasonably think of is: render mask + ignore things outside of view
2019-10-17 11:27:58	yuken	and have all child elements be relative to that element
2019-10-17 11:31:34	R2robot	lol
2019-10-17 11:32:34	R2robot	is there no existing gui lib you can use
2019-10-17 11:32:41	R2robot	there must be hundreds
2019-10-17 11:33:51	yuken	R2robot, none that will integrate smoothly with what I'm doing
2019-10-17 11:34:02	yuken	and also I want to write my own.
2019-10-17 11:34:25	R2robot	i suspect the 2nd sentence it the actual answer :P
2019-10-17 11:34:29	yuken	nop
2019-10-17 11:34:32	R2robot	but oh well
2019-10-17 11:34:36	R2robot	nothing new about that
2019-10-17 11:35:13	yuken	Getting any GUI lib to function nicely with Raylib bindings is gonna be a pain in the ass.
2019-10-17 11:36:47	R2robot	even the raylib gui?
2019-10-17 11:37:18	R2robot	https://github.com/raysan5/raygui
2019-10-17 11:37:19	yuken	Unless you wanna write bindings for me
2019-10-17 11:37:34	R2robot	in what?
2019-10-17 11:37:38	yuken	Rust.
2019-10-17 11:37:48	R2robot	blech

2019-10-17 12:28:19	elsie273	so last night i was working on a thing
2019-10-17 12:28:30	elsie273	and i got a load of crashes related to my hashmap
2019-10-17 12:28:39	elsie273	and i was like, oh no, i thought i fixed this
2019-10-17 12:28:58	elsie273	and thought, maybe i just didn't pull the latest version into this project
2019-10-17 12:29:25	elsie273	i copied the version from my local copy of the repo with the hashmap and everything worked
2019-10-17 12:29:50	elsie273	and then i looked again and realised those changes hadn't been committed
2019-10-17 12:30:03	elsie273	and they've just been sitting on my pc since like august
2019-10-17 12:30:43	elsie273	and i just got super lucky to copy from there instead of doing a refresh pull, lucky to have not just deleted/overwritten that file at some point
2019-10-17 12:31:09	elsie273	past me wrote the fixes better than present me would so i probably would have been screwed
2019-10-17 12:46:06	+zebbiz_pi	elsie273: Nice
2019-10-17 12:46:30	+zebbiz_pi	FOrgetting to commit or push is easy
2019-10-17 12:49:40	elsie273	it's not something i would usually forget
2019-10-17 12:50:11	elsie273	on the plus side ecs systems going over multiple components in a way i like is nearly done
2019-10-17 12:50:31	elsie273	i decided to ditch efficiency for now and just make the interface how i want it

2019-10-17 13:50:03	elsie273	Jonas wuu2?
2019-10-17 14:08:34	yuken	idk if I can manage to write an entire GUI library, I might just have to use C so I can use Raygui.,
2019-10-17 14:35:10	elsie273	yuken imgui?
2019-10-17 14:35:33	yuken	elsie273, wat
2019-10-17 14:35:50	yuken	I'm using Raylib, which has an official GUI library.
2019-10-17 14:36:28	elsie273	yuken one of the most popular gui libraries: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
2019-10-17 14:36:34	yuken	I know that
2019-10-17 14:37:17	elsie273	"i might just have to use c"
2019-10-17 14:37:27	elsie273	what does you mean?
2019-10-17 14:37:38	yuken	Either I have to switch to C(++), or I have to write bindings, elsie273
2019-10-17 14:37:51	elsie273	oh
2019-10-17 14:37:56	+zebbiz_pi	elsie273: yuken is currently working in Rust
2019-10-17 14:38:06	elsie273	oh
2019-10-17 14:38:12	yuken	So those are the 3 options, I'm tryying to figure out which is best.
2019-10-17 14:38:14	elsie273	lots of things have rust bindings
2019-10-17 14:38:19	elsie273	doesn't imgui?
2019-10-17 14:38:27	yuken	No clue, probably?
2019-10-17 14:39:41	elsie273	at least four different attempts: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Bindings
2019-10-17 14:41:38	yuken	Getting any of that to work well with Raylib is gonna be a pain in the ass, elsie273
2019-10-17 14:45:02	elsie273	it shouldn't be so bad
2019-10-17 14:45:31	elsie273	the point of imgui is that you just pass it your gl context and it works
2019-10-17 14:45:49	+zebbiz_pi	yuken: Considering you want to do most of the work yourself, everything will be a pita :P
2019-10-17 14:47:04	yuken	elsie273, 1/4 of those bindings seem to do that o-o
2019-10-17 14:47:17	yuken	1/3*
2019-10-17 14:48:27	elsie273	sounds like you just want to complain. do the work or use gamemaker
2019-10-17 14:48:58	R2robot	yuken: are you the guy that was working on fog of war?
2019-10-17 14:49:18	yuken	elsie273, well I have no clue how to do a lot of what I'm tryna do here, like scrolling containers
2019-10-17 14:50:22	 *	R2robot still thinks you should start with something MUCH smaller and simpler
2019-10-17 14:50:31	R2robot	even 2d
2019-10-17 15:10:07	+carefish	i still think that yuken should just get started with whatever he wants to make
2019-10-17 15:10:17	+carefish	rather than doubt a 'found path' and not deciding to pick anything :p
2019-10-17 15:10:34	yuken	That's what I'm doing carefish, I'm trying to figure out how scrolling stuff works in GUI stuff. and trying to get a cursor up for text stuff.
2019-10-17 15:13:11	+carefish	why not work on your game first
2019-10-17 15:13:20	+carefish	ui stuff can be added while working on the game
2019-10-17 15:13:52	yuken	Because getting the GUI to work is probably the most important part of the game.
2019-10-17 15:14:06	yuken	it's first and foremost a MUD, with the text-based roleplaying that comes with a MUD.
2019-10-17 15:16:28	+carefish	hmmkay
2019-10-17 15:17:16	yuken	Right now, I'm just trying to get text input (copy, pasting, cursor, selection) and scrollable containers (with text wrapping too).
2019-10-17 15:17:28	yuken	and scrolling is what I don't get.
2019-10-17 15:18:28	+carefish	scrolling like scrollbar or scrolling like scrolling text
2019-10-17 15:19:19	yuken	The former. So I could have a big text box that lets you scroll through (because players may be submitting/saving large bodies of text for various reasons)
2019-10-17 15:19:29	yuken	or scrolling through different GUI stuff, like... a list of players.
2019-10-17 15:19:55	+Jonas___	elsie273, I'm jealous of you making progress on ECS
2019-10-17 15:20:08	+Jonas___	it's been years since I worked on mine
2019-10-17 15:20:20	+carefish	so scrollbar requires you to set up a clipping mask yuken
2019-10-17 15:20:31	+carefish	and a contentmask
2019-10-17 15:20:34	+Jonas___	instead I'm now worrying about how to do event driven microservices for real-time high availability web services
2019-10-17 15:20:41	+Jonas___	it's not really ECS at all :|
2019-10-17 15:20:48	+carefish	the content mask is the thing that goes up and down, the clipping mask stays in-place
2019-10-17 15:20:48	yuken	carefish, I can setup masks (probably), that shouldn't be too hard.
2019-10-17 15:20:55	yuken	oh oh oh
2019-10-17 15:21:09	+carefish	i'm using 'content' because it could be anything with this approach. images and whatnot should work too
2019-10-17 15:21:18	yuken	I can render every container onto a separate texture, and then have that "content" mask just be coordinates on that texture (a rectangle)
2019-10-17 15:21:21	yuken	and scroll like that?
2019-10-17 15:21:26	+carefish	yar
2019-10-17 15:22:00	yuken	thanks carefish, I was trying to figure out how I'd do it, that's all I wanted to know :P
2019-10-17 15:22:00	+carefish	though i wouldn't mess with putting all of it on a single texture
2019-10-17 15:22:09	+carefish	that's overcomplicating what you are aiming to achieve
2019-10-17 15:22:11	yuken	er
2019-10-17 15:22:15	yuken	every container onto its own texture.
2019-10-17 15:22:31	+carefish	so then you have a container with multilpe containers each their own texture
2019-10-17 15:22:51	yuken	hmm
2019-10-17 15:23:03	+carefish	it's "smart" to try and draw everything on one texture... but since you don't have anything working yet just start with whatever you can get to work first
2019-10-17 15:23:39	+carefish	which almost always leads to a suboptimal way of doing things, but at least it will give you a much better vantage point than you have now

2019-10-17 16:16:06	+carefish	ie: instead of going C++ with SDL2, start with unity3d or anyother engine that allows you to be quickly visually reinforced with your learning and progress
2019-10-17 16:16:24	+bomb	like making an open world VR MMORPG for PS5
2019-10-17 16:16:36	+carefish	once you get the feel for what programming is, try to take on harder things... like C++ with SDL2
2019-10-17 16:16:43	yuken	R2robot, I have decent experience, just never released a product.
2019-10-17 16:16:43	R2robot	yeah
2019-10-17 16:16:52	yuken	R2robot, and I'm not trying to make some masterful product, just a simple 2D MUD.
2019-10-17 16:17:05	+carefish	i strongly believe that that's the core strength of those 'simpler' engines (game maker, unity, godot, probably others)
2019-10-17 16:17:08	R2robot	yuken: games are hard. :)
2019-10-17 16:17:15	yuken	well duh, enver said it was easy
2019-10-17 16:17:18	yuken	but I ain't making Half-Life 4.
2019-10-17 16:17:38	+carefish	to help fledgling programmers/hobbyists learn programming/scripting by SHOWING the result rather than working TO the result
2019-10-17 16:17:47	R2robot	I often tell people to make breakout.  You learn all about gamedev from such a simple game. AND you learn how difficult it is to finish a game.
2019-10-17 16:17:59	yuken	I've made Breakout & Snake before. And full games.
2019-10-17 16:18:11	R2robot	links?
2019-10-17 16:18:14	+carefish	i remember being somewhat dissapointed it took me a couple of days to get a simple sprite to render with lazyfoo's tutorials (i didn't know anything about C++ or build systems or whatnot at the time)
2019-10-17 16:18:16	yuken	Just never... released any, and they've all been lost to time because when I made these games
2019-10-17 16:18:19	yuken	I didn't bother to back anything up.
2019-10-17 16:18:31	+carefish	R2robot: i think breakout is still 'complex' though
2019-10-17 16:18:37	+carefish	imo pong is a better start
2019-10-17 16:18:41	R2robot	yeah
2019-10-17 16:18:53	+carefish	pong also gives you a springboard to move to breakout
2019-10-17 16:19:21	R2robot	yep
2019-10-17 16:19:26	R2robot	sound advice :D
2019-10-17 16:19:37	+carefish	and going back to that memory, i also remember it took me 15 minutes to get not only a sprite to show in unity, but i could make it jump and collide with things and not really worry about 'how' that all worked
2019-10-17 16:20:16	+bomb	just give your kids Qbasic64 for extreme productivity
2019-10-17 16:20:36	+carefish	though i started with Flash games, moved to XNA, tried C++ with SDL, found out i couldn't learn opengl due to study stress, had to switch to unity3d to actually make something
2019-10-17 16:20:51	+bomb	you were making Flash games?
2019-10-17 16:21:06	+carefish	i still think XNA, even though it's dead af, is a good starting point for many people which are more 'code oriented'
2019-10-17 16:21:19	+bomb	like, using Flash-the-program, or something like Flixel, FlashPunk, etc.?
2019-10-17 16:21:38	+carefish	it's super unlikely you'll hit performance problems with XNA, and it will be relatively easy to remove/reduce perf eaters
2019-10-17 16:21:43	+carefish	all of it bomb
2019-10-17 16:21:54	+carefish	i used to have the flash editor hooked to flashdevelop
2019-10-17 16:22:04	+carefish	or just a plain flashdevelop project that spat out an swf
2019-10-17 16:22:10	+bomb	also, if you liked XNA, you'd just enjoy MonoGame or FNA as well
2019-10-17 16:22:25	+bomb	HaxeFlixel with Haxedevelop <3
2019-10-17 16:22:40	+carefish	i haven't used FNA/monogame since by then i was already busy with unity3d and some haxe projects
2019-10-17 16:22:54	+carefish	imo haxe is fucking amazing at what it does, it's such a shame people scoff at it
2019-10-17 16:23:08	elsie273	yuken has been in this channel with stuff for a long time
2019-10-17 16:23:19	elsie273	yuken didn't you make a networked 2d platformer?
2019-10-17 16:24:35	+bomb	carefish: Haxe guys are working on a new VM. it's gonna make porting game to all platforms easier
2019-10-17 16:24:42	+carefish	hehe
2019-10-17 16:24:46	+carefish	that's awesome
2019-10-17 16:24:49	yuken	elsie273, I didn't do the networking, that was made in an engine that handled networking for me.
2019-10-17 16:24:54	+bomb	yeah. no hxcpp hackery anymore
2019-10-17 16:25:03	+carefish	i was fine with hxcpp hackery
2019-10-17 16:25:09	+carefish	it worked, and worked performantly
2019-10-17 16:25:39	+carefish	what i really liked, although at the time i didn't have enough knowledge to properly use it.... is to have haxe spit out the source code humanreadable
2019-10-17 16:26:12	+carefish	so you could learn and see how haxe use(d/s?) SDL under the hood to help you do a lot of things)
2019-10-17 16:26:47	yuken	I think the GUI and networking portions of this game are gonna be the hardest parts tbh
2019-10-17 16:27:01	+bomb	carefish: i mean, hxcpp is nice. but when it doesn't work, you're screwed
2019-10-17 16:27:13	+bomb	it was really difficult to debug last time i tried many years ago
2019-10-17 16:27:18	+bomb	during NME days, IIRC
2019-10-17 16:28:33	+carefish	hehe yeah
2019-10-17 16:28:40	+carefish	i remember the split between openfl and nme
2019-10-17 16:29:06	+carefish	still though, haxe is pretty darn cool. it's too bad i don't have an active use for it
2019-10-17 16:29:25	+bomb	because you don't do web games anymore?
2019-10-17 16:29:49	+carefish	nope
2019-10-17 16:32:56	elsie273	yuken but you still made something was my point

2019-10-17 16:33:12	elsie273	it doesn't matter if you wrote the networking
2019-10-17 16:33:38	elsie273	everyone is writing things with tools that do half the everything for them. it's fine
2019-10-17 16:34:56	 *	R2robot has also been in the channel a long time
2019-10-17 16:35:02	R2robot	lurking -_-
2019-10-17 16:36:44	yuken	elsie273, then yes, although I never finished that one :P
2019-10-17 16:37:00	+carefish	bomb: the thing i would think about using haxe for... is port old flash apps (not games) to a native model, like hxcpp
2019-10-17 16:37:03	R2robot	lol
2019-10-17 16:38:30	+carefish	IIRC one of VMWare's tools is still Flash based
2019-10-17 16:38:39	+carefish	i would most definitely try to port that away from flash

2019-10-17 16:39:40	yuken	carefish, ESXI's web GUI was until recently
2019-10-17 16:39:45	yuken	whhich may be what you're thinking about (it isn't anymore)
2019-10-17 16:40:01	+carefish	you'd think that
2019-10-17 16:40:17	+carefish	i know of several companies still stuck with the flash thing due to licensing/can't easily phase it out/etc
2019-10-17 16:40:29	yuken	das silly
2019-10-17 16:41:10	+carefish	at least one of those companies refuses to use the new thing till it's been out for a while

2019-10-18 09:24:50	+DrAwesomeClaws	has anyone in here who watches anime watched Sound and Fury yet?  Curious as to what those who actually watch this stuff think.
2019-10-18 09:27:37	Syrinxos	Good morning! ^^
2019-10-18 09:36:50	+Jonas___	haven't even heard of it, DrAwesomeClaws
2019-10-18 09:36:56	+Jonas___	morning Syrinxos
2019-10-18 09:37:23	+DrAwesomeClaws	Jonas___, country artist sturgill simpson teamed up with some japanese guys to make an anime for his synth wave disco rock album
2019-10-18 09:37:37	+Jonas___	haha, that explains it
2019-10-18 09:37:42	+DrAwesomeClaws	it's on netflix
2019-10-18 09:37:46	+Jonas___	the official trailer gave me that kind of vibe
2019-10-18 09:38:06	+DrAwesomeClaws	my favorite album of the decade
2019-10-18 09:38:12	+DrAwesomeClaws	possibly century, too early to tell though
2019-10-18 09:38:49	+Jonas___	I'll have to listen to the album
2019-10-18 09:39:31	+DrAwesomeClaws	the anime is just the album as well. No dialog, just music with crazy cartoons
2019-10-18 09:39:37	-->	larpon (~larpon@193-106-166-119.ip4.fiberby.net) has joined #reddit-gamedev
2019-10-18 09:40:37	+DrAwesomeClaws	it wont make me start watching anime, but i think im gonna buy some japanese tools
2019-10-18 09:42:54	+Jonas___	perturbator, that's one of the bands it reminded me of
2019-10-18 09:43:11	+Jonas___	though I haven't heard the actual songs so it may be way different
2019-10-18 09:43:23	+DrAwesomeClaws	oh, and hi Syrinxos
2019-10-18 09:43:33	+Jonas___	that and carpenter brut, which seems appropriate for your hobby
2019-10-18 09:44:49	+DrAwesomeClaws	Perturbator is different, but there's certainly some crossover
2019-10-18 09:45:40	+DrAwesomeClaws	sound and fury spotlights the synth as well, with a twangy guitar rock and/or disco background
2019-10-18 09:46:58	+DrAwesomeClaws	Perturbator makes me feel like im in a montage in an 80s movie
2019-10-18 09:47:01	+DrAwesomeClaws	that's not a bad thing
2019-10-18 10:07:23	IkeKrull	show us on the doll where you where peturbated
2019-10-18 10:09:40	+DrAwesomeClaws	so i've been using deezer for music streaming lately
2019-10-18 10:09:43	+DrAwesomeClaws	and it's pretty good
2019-10-18 10:09:50	+DrAwesomeClaws	but im thinking of unsubscribing for one reason

2019-10-18 10:10:18	+DrAwesomeClaws	when you click the album art it doesn't show it larger.  For that you have to click the stupid "..." menu and choose "zoom in on album"
2019-10-18 10:10:30	+Jonas___	an unforgivable sin
2019-10-18 10:10:37	+DrAwesomeClaws	it's fucking rediculous
2019-10-18 10:11:04	+Jonas___	just send their support/feedback an angry message about how stupid it is and how they are bad people for not having fixed it
2019-10-18 10:11:19	+Jonas___	that's what I do when I have to use a service that has a ridiculous restriction
2019-10-18 10:11:29	+DrAwesomeClaws	they'll probably tell me it works if i don't use the shitty unmaintained wine aur package
2019-10-18 10:11:30	+Jonas___	makes me feel better and gives them at least a chance to get feedback on the issue
2019-10-18 10:11:35	+Jonas___	oh
2019-10-18 10:12:08	+DrAwesomeClaws	actually i think it's maintained, haha. But there's a good chance it's somehow my fault
2019-10-18 10:12:09	+DrAwesomeClaws	but still
2019-10-18 10:12:27	+Jonas___	elsie273, a faster valgrind-ish huh?  I remember writing an AI in my game and making it time-stepped just for the purposes of being able to test a "playthrough" in valgrind, as it was way too slow to even play otherwise
2019-10-18 10:12:52	+Jonas___	making the game physics + AI time-stepped, I should say
2019-10-18 10:14:10	+DrAwesomeClaws	i forgot valgrind was a think that exists
2019-10-18 10:14:22	+DrAwesomeClaws	just spent 2 minutes wondering why i knew that word
2019-10-18 10:16:22	+DrAwesomeClaws	i should do the oscp test for fun.  I paid for the labs and stuff long ago then just never took the test because i lose interest after i actually learn something
2019-10-18 10:16:45	+DrAwesomeClaws	but i think that's when i was using valgrind a lot
2019-10-18 10:18:03	+Jonas___	oscp huh, we've got a hacker harry in our midst
2019-10-18 10:18:13	+DrAwesomeClaws	you should refer to me as Mr Robot
2019-10-18 10:18:21	+Jonas___	I'm glad I have my IRC mask on so I don't get superhacked
2019-10-18 10:18:58	IkeKrull	i can see your ip address is 127.0.0.1! i'm hacking you *right now* youre gonna be pwned so hard..
2019-10-18 10:19:10	+Jonas___	looks like an interesting course tho
2019-10-18 10:19:12	+DrAwesomeClaws	shit, i didn't know there was another hacker in here
2019-10-18 10:19:26	+Jonas___	IkeKrull, don't hack that, that's where I keep all my files
2019-10-18 10:20:12	+DrAwesomeClaws	oscp is good shit.  The cert actually requires you be able to do stuff.  No multiple choice bullshit
2019-10-18 10:20:48	+DrAwesomeClaws	test is: they give you a big fake corporate network and you have 24 hours to comprimise it.  Then 24 hours to write a pen test report boring paper
2019-10-18 10:20:54	+Jonas___	yeah, that's what seems appealing, it might actually teach me a thing
2019-10-18 10:21:15	+DrAwesomeClaws	and the labs are simulated networks.  Down to network traffic happening in real time and stuff
2019-10-18 10:21:42	+Jonas___	that's cool
2019-10-18 10:22:08	+Jonas___	do you get to access a similar network for practice, or is it a simulated live scenario that you only get to do once?
2019-10-18 10:22:33	+DrAwesomeClaws	yes, the labs are similar to what you'll see in the main test
2019-10-18 10:22:49	+DrAwesomeClaws	different networks/vulns and stuff
2019-10-18 10:23:06	+DrAwesomeClaws	but each is basically a big, super detailed ctf with many systems
2019-10-18 10:25:36	+Jonas___	sounds like a lot of fun
2019-10-18 10:25:46	+Jonas___	I wish I could say I would have the time to invest in getting to know it
2019-10-18 10:26:20	+Jonas___	then again it would probably not be a very useful skill for me, in a job setting I have other things I'm a lot better at than pentesting
2019-10-18 10:27:36	+DrAwesomeClaws	i'd like to get back into that stuff, but it's also not very relevant for me atm
2019-10-18 10:28:08	+DrAwesomeClaws	though i fear someday i'll be kidnapped by terrorists and won't be able to hack them to save the world if i don't brush up sometime soon
2019-10-18 10:28:36	+Jonas___	you'll have to fall back to building a fusion powered iron man suit to blow them up
2019-10-18 10:28:48	+DrAwesomeClaws	i've been going down a category theory rabbit hole
2019-10-18 10:29:00	+DrAwesomeClaws	that's a good idea
2019-10-18 10:29:20	+DrAwesomeClaws	https://www.youtube.com/user/DrBartosz/videos  this dudes lectures are good
