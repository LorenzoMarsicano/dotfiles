2019-07-08 12:08:22	xPaw	reverse engineered the query/ping stuff in bedrock, and you can easily break it by having ";" character in server name it seems ðŸ¤”
2019-07-08 12:08:43	xPaw	fields are split by ; and nothing stops you from using that in serv name
2019-07-08 12:36:45	x10A94	imagine using some weird ass separator format instead of JSON or something alike
2019-07-08 12:44:07	xPaw	funny you mention that, java minecraft can use json
2019-07-08 12:44:18	xPaw	bedrock uses RakNet for networking, or at least based on it
2019-07-08 12:44:21	x10A94	that's why I mentioned it

2019-07-12 16:21:43	mgodzilla	lucky.
2019-07-12 16:22:35	+Dickie	I changed my diet up, stopped eating and then lying down (which I think was the primary culprit). Also I drink less alcohol.
2019-07-12 16:22:57	+Dickie	The latter was never a problem (says the drunk), but I cut back anyway.
2019-07-12 16:24:37	+Dickie	So just change your life drastically in one of the only means you have at acheiving joy. No big. You'll be fine.
2019-07-12 16:24:48	aperson	mgodzilla: my little brother had both of those done at the same time too

2019-07-15 09:13:19	dansan	I had to port OpenJDK to mips recently -- that was a bear!  But this is purely interpreted, no JIT compiler.  Somebody needed this for a project on a board with only 256MiB of ram and a 800HMz 32-bit mips cpu
2019-07-15 09:13:44	dansan	we thought they were crazy, but they paid us for it, lol!

2019-07-15 09:22:23	MiniDigger	"general inefficiency and insecurity of Java" <--- mmh?
2019-07-15 09:22:57	MiniDigger	and whats wrong with javas licencing agreement?
2019-07-15 09:23:40	MiniDigger	as long as you don't buy commercial licences its just gplv2 with classpath exception
2019-07-15 09:24:15	MiniDigger	not sure why java is any less secure than any other language, if you ignore applets of course, but those are ded
2019-07-15 09:48:48	riceandb1ans	Java basically has CVEs as a core language feature
2019-07-15 09:56:51	riceandb1ans	In terms of inefficiency, it's dog slow and leaks memory perpetually, it's obnoxious to admin
2019-07-15 09:59:25	riceandb1ans	I'm waiting for Veloren to make a little more progress, Rust is awesome and it's making huge headway

2019-07-15 16:42:53	Dickie	I feel like chicken eggs don't spawn chickens in the same numbers
2019-07-15 16:43:56	x10A94	it seems like it only works if the lava is taken away the exact same tick
2019-07-15 16:44:06	x10A94	or like a tick after
2019-07-15 16:44:19	x10A94	otherwise you get jack shit
2019-07-15 16:45:18	Dickie	You don't have to take the lava away, do you?
2019-07-15 16:45:40	Dickie	If the chick is on a half block, they fit below the lava. Then they grow, hit the lava, and drop the cooked chicken under the lava.

2019-07-15 16:46:18	Andrio	Won't they jump into the lava?
2019-07-15 16:47:07	+Dickie	Do chicks jump?
2019-07-15 16:47:21	+Dickie	without somewhere to jump to?
2019-07-15 16:49:08	+Dickie	I win.
2019-07-15 16:49:26	Andrio	Congrats.
2019-07-15 16:54:24	+Dickie	But anyway, I've had no issues pre-1.14 with a chicken cooker using my method. I haven't created one on the new server yet.
2019-07-15 16:55:00	+Dickie	A bunch of chickens packed into a small area (egg-layers for the machine) causes problems on the server sometimes.
2019-07-15 16:57:43	Andrio	and they'd suffocate to death
2019-07-15 16:58:14	+Dickie	Sometimes, yes.
2019-07-15 16:58:52	+Dickie	But usually I get greedy with entities. Settling near a dungeon, putting up frames for storage chests to show their contents, raising animals, autofarms, etc.

2019-07-15 17:21:43	+sixwheeledbeast	I noticed that lava will burn items even before they hit it now. Like if you have lower flowing lava for example
2019-07-15 17:24:17	+sixwheeledbeast	I doubt that would affect your chick cooker tho. Do the drops still come from eye level?
2019-07-15 17:26:42	+sixwheeledbeast	Maybe swapping half block for a trapdoor will help drop more cooked chicken when they grow.
