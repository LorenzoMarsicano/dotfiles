2019-09-13 10:52:41	vn971	Hi. Suppose I want to call a function that returns Result. If it will return Err, I want to add some additional information to the stack trace, but still error out (either panic or return an enriched Err up to the caller).
2019-09-13 10:52:44	vn971	How should I do that?
2019-09-13 10:53:21	vn971	I know I can, for example, use .unwrap_or_else(|err| panic!("... reason: {}", err));
2019-09-13 10:53:35	vn971	but that kinda transforms the err to a string. Is that OK?
2019-09-13 10:53:45	vn971	(I feel that it's not.)
2019-09-13 10:54:50	j`ey	well that panics, so you dont really pass a string anywhere

2019-09-13 10:56:07	j`ey	vn971: you can make your own struct MyError that wraps the error and includes extra info?

2019-09-13 13:20:54	vn971	oherrala: docker also makes your system super-insecure if you allow your user to access the docker daemon.

2019-09-13 13:31:35	vn971	avu: oh right, it's not that simple. I forgot the exact details then, but there's a ton of ways to get root on host if you have access to docker daemon. Docker itself kinda says it, unwillingly, in the part that describes giving access to the daemon.
2019-09-13 13:32:43	vn971	it was a bit more honest on that and there was a whole section describing the impact and why it can't be made secure, but then they decided to shrink/remove this part and there's only some small notice. Last time I checked at least. But the notice is still there.
2019-09-13 13:33:49	vn971	oherrala: chroot still requires you to use `root`. It's just being made explicit. You know that anybody who runs chroots can also damage your system, so it should only be you.
2019-09-13 13:34:14	vn971	(with docker, some people don't understand that having access to docker daemon == having root.)
2019-09-13 13:35:51	vn971	nepugia: linux has namespaces still, which can be unshared. E.g. bubblewrap, or just `unshare` if you don't want to touch mount points.
2019-09-13 13:35:53	oherrala	vn971: So Docker is super insecure because some people don't understand it?
2019-09-13 13:36:25	oherrala	vn971: probably the same people who use sudo?
2019-09-13 13:36:29	vn971	oherrala: whether docker is secure or not I don't know in detail, but _having access to docker daemon_ is the same as having root on your system.
2019-09-13 13:36:56	nepugia	vn971, i honestly dont know how namespaces would protect you against someone mounting disk devices
2019-09-13 13:37:06	lupine	best not to install docker, really
2019-09-13 13:37:17	vn971	oherrala: comparing to sudo, docker is then a password-less sudo (in a sense that it can easily be abused to raise priveleges, in an automated way).
2019-09-13 13:37:20	nepugia	best to install docker when it fits your usecase
2019-09-13 13:37:27	lupine	its only purpose is to make capitalists happy
2019-09-13 13:37:34	Faux	You can run container-like things, with safe mounting, inside user namespaces, if you're up for that kind of thing.
2019-09-13 13:38:34	Faux	https://paste.debian.net/1100536/ this doesn't need root, and is enabled by default in e.g. ubuntu's kernels.
2019-09-13 13:39:09	nepugia	namespaces are nice indeed
2019-09-13 13:39:58	vorner	Unprivileged dockers don't have the physical devices visible in them, so you can't mount them. Also, you can run the docker daemon with user privileges.

2019-09-13 13:55:07	nepugia	oh, you mount a tmpfs over it

2019-09-13 13:55:39	vn971	nepugia: inside the jail, there are no suid programs, no way to invoke root, no `sudo` that would work.
2019-09-13 13:56:06	nepugia	how so? namespaces have root processes too...
2019-09-13 13:56:18	nepugia	just that root means somethign slightly different
2019-09-13 13:56:43	vn971	nepugia: I mean, if you run bubblewrap from non-root, then you will remain non-root.
2019-09-13 13:56:59	vn971	vorner: in the last link you're clearly confusing docker daemon with programs that are running inside docker.
2019-09-13 13:57:01	vorner	vn971, I think it starts with root itself. But it is not willing to start privileged containers and remaps all users (even 0/root) in the container onto UIDs that are non-root.
2019-09-13 13:57:13	vn971	vorner: blease educate yourself on the difference, TBH...
2019-09-13 13:58:02	nepugia	the programm seams to be setuid(0) so non-root isnt right i suppose
2019-09-13 13:58:56	nepugia	welp, the entire toolchain doesnt seam to want to work in my void linux chroot
2019-09-13 13:59:12	vn971	nepugia: it provides a limited subset of the so called user namespaces. It's setuid, it configures mount points, does unshares, and then strips off root rights and runs your actual thing without root again.
2019-09-13 14:00:07	nepugia	i dont see why i would need that for my usecase
2019-09-13 14:00:14	vn971	vorner: > But it is not willing to start privileged containers  -- I think this is an incorrect statement. The whole link is about which restricted containers can you run inside docker, not how you start `dockerd`.
2019-09-13 14:00:23	nepugia	the only thing i want to do is confuse processes as to where they shall look for glibc, which works fine with chroot
2019-09-13 14:00:58	vorner	vn971, Sorry, it's been a while since I looked into that thing. I need that crap (docker) in work, so I did do the research years ago and found the least evil way to run it on my system.
2019-09-13 14:01:05	vn971	nepugia: well you could do `bwrap --bind /path/to/chroot / bash`

2019-09-13 14:08:08	vorner	Anyway, I'm pretty sure the unprivileged docker container is unable to do mknod or so and root inside (UID=0) is not really privileged with that setup. It's probably not 100% secure, but stuff like mounting things in use the privileges of the outside user, so if you want to mount something in, you actually have to make it something like word-readable.

2019-09-13 14:10:42	vn971	vorner: luckily docker is still honest about the security properties, so read this: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/
2019-09-13 14:10:42	vn971	> Warning: Changing the default docker daemon binding to a TCP port or Unix docker user group will increase your security risks by allowing non-root users to gain root access on the host. Make sure you control access to docker. If you are binding to a TCP port, anyone with access to that port has full Docker access; so it is not advisable on an open network.
2019-09-13 14:11:48	vn971	* relatively honest, as this crucial thing is only written somewhere in the middle, so many people do not know it.

2019-09-13 14:13:52	vorner	Yes, but that note assumes that you also run without the user namespace mapping option. Then you can start a docker with `--privileged` and have a root. If you start docker with the user-ns and try that, you get „Error response from daemon: privileged mode is incompatible with user namespaces.“ and it won't run.
2019-09-13 14:14:10	vorner	>  Potentially the most important security improvement is that, by default, container processes running as the root user will have expected administrative privilege (with some restrictions) inside the container but will effectively be mapped to an unprivileged uid on the host.

2019-09-13 14:37:29	vorner	No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying that if I run dockerd with the `--user-ns` *parameter*, it itself runs as root, yes, but refuses to start a container not mapped to your user. And the way to gain the root access to the host is by executing a privileged container and mapping the whole system into it or something such. It won't work with dockerd with the userns parameter, it'll refuse to do so.

2019-09-13 16:23:23	Lumpio-	Something that is AsRef but not a Vec

2019-09-13 16:26:45	Lumpio-	At that point you might as well say Parser: Fn(Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8>
2019-09-13 16:26:58	j`ey	hm
2019-09-13 16:27:08	j`ey	maybe I meant something like Vec<u8>: Into<Input>?

2019-09-13 16:27:28	Lumpio-	Has a couple of convenience methods Vec doesn't

2019-09-13 16:32:49	j`ey	I think they wanted Parser to be able take either &[u8] or &Vec<u8> hence the use of AsRef
