2019-10-22 17:43:06	nnyby	a related question.. SDL_PIXELFORMAT_INDEX8 seems to be the default 8-bit pixel format. is that correct? in other words, is SDL_CreateRGBSurfaceWithFormat(0, w, h, 8, SDL_PIXELFORMAT_INDEX8); equivalent to SDL_CreateRGBSurface(0, w, h, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0);
2019-10-22 17:44:16	nnyby	ultimately, i'm just curious if this code change here looks right: https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/pull/7793/files

2019-10-24 13:41:14	DuClare	What was the bottleneck
2019-10-24 13:41:45	DuClare	I also often find my stuff bottlenecked by crappy compilers that don't know how to optimize
2019-10-24 13:42:12	DuClare	Then you figure out a way to coerce the compiler and go from 5 fps to 25

2019-10-28 10:20:59	R2robot	hehe, why?
2019-10-28 10:21:59	DuClare	They have bugs and issues I can't fix with reasonable effort
2019-10-28 10:22:10	DuClare	And I'm tired of wasting my limited free time trying to make a game work well
2019-10-28 10:23:05	DuClare	Also, they offer no portability
2019-10-28 10:23:26	DuClare	So I'm locked to whatever system they chose to bless, or fucked.
2019-10-28 10:24:01	DuClare	To me that speaks of two things: 1) the game is meant to be disposable  2) the developer does not respect their user

2019-10-28 10:24:47	DuClare	That is not how I want games to be.  So I'm not really inclined to support that garbage industry.
2019-10-28 10:26:02	DuClare	Add to it the fact that most games turn out to be crap..

2019-10-28 10:26:54	DuClare	So I spend 5-10 hours trying to make a game run well, then play it for 2 hours only to find I don't enjoy it
2019-10-28 10:27:18	DuClare	That's at least half a weekend wasted
2019-10-28 10:27:24	DuClare	Life is too short for that

2019-10-31 13:17:04	_8bitbubsy	I have a strange problem with SDL2 on a Windows computer. If Num Lock is on and I hold left shift while pressing the period button on the numpad, I receive a key-up event for the left shift first
2019-10-31 13:17:42	_8bitbubsy	this is problematic because I need to use this keybinding for something in my program, but with this behavior it seems impossible to know if shift really is held down while the numpad period key is pressed

2019-11-08 17:11:27	fogobogo	afaik its a simple matter of proper server config
2019-11-08 17:11:42	Xeek	depends on yoru host, most hosting packges gives you free unlimited subdomains, tis' the primary domain that costs money froma registrar, the subdomains are mearly server configurations
2019-11-08 17:12:08	fogobogo	what Xeek said ^
2019-11-08 17:12:38	Xeek	with xeekworx.com I get unlimited subdomains and emails, I think unlimited parked domains too, but registration costs money, ~$14.99 per year usually. Most hosting account though is $12.99 /mo
2019-11-08 17:12:57	Xeek	with xeek.xyz though, its my server hear next to me, I can do as much as I want :D
