2019-10-22 17:43:06	nnyby	a related question.. SDL_PIXELFORMAT_INDEX8 seems to be the default 8-bit pixel format. is that correct? in other words, is SDL_CreateRGBSurfaceWithFormat(0, w, h, 8, SDL_PIXELFORMAT_INDEX8); equivalent to SDL_CreateRGBSurface(0, w, h, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0);
2019-10-22 17:44:16	nnyby	ultimately, i'm just curious if this code change here looks right: https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/pull/7793/files

2019-10-24 13:41:14	DuClare	What was the bottleneck
2019-10-24 13:41:45	DuClare	I also often find my stuff bottlenecked by crappy compilers that don't know how to optimize
2019-10-24 13:42:12	DuClare	Then you figure out a way to coerce the compiler and go from 5 fps to 25

2019-10-28 10:20:59	R2robot	hehe, why?
2019-10-28 10:21:59	DuClare	They have bugs and issues I can't fix with reasonable effort
2019-10-28 10:22:10	DuClare	And I'm tired of wasting my limited free time trying to make a game work well
2019-10-28 10:23:05	DuClare	Also, they offer no portability
2019-10-28 10:23:26	DuClare	So I'm locked to whatever system they chose to bless, or fucked.
2019-10-28 10:24:01	DuClare	To me that speaks of two things: 1) the game is meant to be disposable  2) the developer does not respect their user

2019-10-28 10:24:47	DuClare	That is not how I want games to be.  So I'm not really inclined to support that garbage industry.
2019-10-28 10:26:02	DuClare	Add to it the fact that most games turn out to be crap..

2019-10-28 10:26:54	DuClare	So I spend 5-10 hours trying to make a game run well, then play it for 2 hours only to find I don't enjoy it
2019-10-28 10:27:18	DuClare	That's at least half a weekend wasted
2019-10-28 10:27:24	DuClare	Life is too short for that

2019-10-31 13:17:04	_8bitbubsy	I have a strange problem with SDL2 on a Windows computer. If Num Lock is on and I hold left shift while pressing the period button on the numpad, I receive a key-up event for the left shift first
2019-10-31 13:17:42	_8bitbubsy	this is problematic because I need to use this keybinding for something in my program, but with this behavior it seems impossible to know if shift really is held down while the numpad period key is pressed

2019-11-08 17:11:27	fogobogo	afaik its a simple matter of proper server config
2019-11-08 17:11:42	Xeek	depends on yoru host, most hosting packges gives you free unlimited subdomains, tis' the primary domain that costs money froma registrar, the subdomains are mearly server configurations
2019-11-08 17:12:08	fogobogo	what Xeek said ^
2019-11-08 17:12:38	Xeek	with xeekworx.com I get unlimited subdomains and emails, I think unlimited parked domains too, but registration costs money, ~$14.99 per year usually. Most hosting account though is $12.99 /mo
2019-11-08 17:12:57	Xeek	with xeek.xyz though, its my server hear next to me, I can do as much as I want :D

2019-11-14 11:35:52	wickedmic	Hi, I'm trying to figure out what unit the timestamp member in the variouse event struct has and I can't find it anywhere in the documentation. Is it the unix timestamp? or maybe the seconds since OS start?
2019-11-14 11:40:23	demonicmaniac3	it used to be filled in by calls to SDL_GetTicks() but my info is from sdl2 2.0.0 i dunno if it's still accurate
2019-11-14 11:43:21	demonicmaniac3	looking 2.0.10 source code it still seems to be SDL_GetTicks()

2019-11-18 13:25:20	blast007	I'm seeing an issue with SDL 1.2 on Linux where a key up event is being sent for a key that is still being held down.  It happens when another key is pressed and released while holding down the first key.  It only seems to happen when in fullscreen.
2019-11-18 13:25:49	blast007	I have an example of the issue with a little test program using SDL and SDL_ttf.  https://gist.github.com/blast007/7f7a4fe7bb3ca9ddcb23d5c085353110
2019-11-18 13:26:18	blast007	Is there something I'm doing wrong that's causing that to happen?

2019-11-18 14:04:13	demonicmaniac3	the seconds after being random is really weird. at most i'd have expected it to change directly after releasing spacebar. should probably check it with older xorg/xlib versions when it broke. it definitely used to work

2019-11-18 14:11:40	blast007	I had a previous version of that code that wrote out the events to the console, and I was seeing a key up every second or so (can't recall exactly, that was a while ago) for the first key until I released it
2019-11-18 14:13:03	blast007	I'm using Debian 10's SDL 1.2.15, using Gnome on Xorg (not Wayland).
2019-11-18 14:16:07	demonicmaniac3	found some bug reports on dosbox pages fullscreen back to april/may 2019
2019-11-18 14:19:01	demonicmaniac3	xorg input abi is at 24.1 or something atm since 1.20 and 1.20 came out around that time so that sounds like
2019-11-18 14:19:08	demonicmaniac3	would probably try with xorg 1.19
2019-11-18 14:19:37	blast007	this is possibly the earliest report from our users: https://forums.bzflag.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=20017
2019-11-18 14:20:49	demonicmaniac3	possible with manjaros delay, 1.20 hit arch around may 2018
2019-11-18 14:21:02	demonicmaniac3	most non rolling distros will not have moved to 1.20 until very late, probably buntu 19.04
2019-11-18 14:21:31	demonicmaniac3	definitely something xorg input abi or libinput
2019-11-18 14:21:50	demonicmaniac3	i'd rather think xorg though considering it only happens in fullscreen
2019-11-18 14:23:37	blast007	Also of note is that it doesn't happen when we use SDL 2.
2019-11-18 14:25:34	demonicmaniac3	well yes sdl2 is maintained sdl 1.2 isn't for ages :P
2019-11-18 14:25:48	blast007	:)
2019-11-18 14:26:02	demonicmaniac3	1.2.15 is from 2012
2019-11-18 14:26:37	demonicmaniac3	patches since then have been user contributions mostly with the whole patch where found but i tried hg head on 1.2 and it still shows the behaviour
2019-11-18 14:28:55	demonicmaniac3	the sdl 1.2 code at least doesn't do anything different between windowed/fullscreen for events in any way
2019-11-18 14:42:10	demonicmaniac3	hmmmm digging through a few changelogs i find sdl 2.0.2 changelog saying Linux: * Fixed fullscreen and focused behavior when receiving NotifyGrab events
2019-11-18 14:42:44	demonicmaniac3	but that's too old with 2014 can't be it

2019-11-22 13:48:36	Leandros	Hey, I've stumbled upon the `window_magic` in the video driver struct. This seems to prevent me from passing an SDL_Window * handle to a DLL, since the static `_this` is going to be different. Is there a semi-official way of using an SDL_Window (which is initialized in the exe) in a DLL? I could always look into the private structs but I really
2019-11-22 13:48:37	Leandros	want to avoid this for various reasons.
2019-11-22 13:50:22	slvn_	Leandros, not sure about your issue, but there is some binary/API compatibility.
2019-11-22 13:51:24	Leandros	I'm basically passing an `SDL_Window *`, which is created in an executable, to a DLL.
2019-11-22 13:51:45	Leandros	Calling any function (e.g SDL_GetWindowSize) will trigger this: https://github.com/spurious/SDL-mirror/blob/8567ce86de318d9a183df0fcde070f418ff91408/src/video/SDL_video.c#L130
2019-11-22 13:52:16	Leandros	I also need to initialize SDL twice. Once in the exe, once in the dll.

2019-11-25 15:31:42	joakim12	Hi! I'm trying to make a SDL2 loop that does not wait forever for input, but checks for input and if there aint any, the it goes forward with the program. My loop is here: https://pastebin.com/1tEEw5Np
2019-11-25 15:38:40	Xeek	well first we need to change that to SDL_PollEvent from SDL_WaitEventTimeout
2019-11-25 15:39:23	Xeek	and second we need to move all that logic and rendering outside of the event loop, to below it, inside the main game loop
2019-11-25 15:39:55	joakim12	I tried SDL_PollEvent too.
2019-11-25 15:40:18	Xeek	well, it's definitely teh way forward, so I probalby need to know why it didn't help you
2019-11-25 15:40:32	Xeek	might be because you have all of your logic / rendering inside the event loop which isn't likely what you want
2019-11-25 15:40:50	Xeek	you call RenderScene() there twice too, I'm unsure why
2019-11-25 15:42:57	joakim12	This is my only loop. I don't have any other.

2019-11-26 10:51:06	swivel	EvanR: I don't think that's the trouble, looking at online perlin and simplex noise references and tutorials there's a bit of details surrounding scaling the output to -1..+1
2019-11-26 10:52:29	EvanR	from what range
2019-11-26 10:54:24	swivel	EvanR: what do you mean?
2019-11-26 10:54:43	EvanR	scaling from what to -1+1
2019-11-26 10:55:54	EvanR	0 to 2^64-1 ?
2019-11-26 10:57:44	demonicmaniac3	EvanR:  https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/11/25/hpe_ssd_32768/ here's some fun
2019-11-26 10:57:59	swivel	EvanR: it's perlin noise
2019-11-26 10:58:55	EvanR	you said that already...
2019-11-26 10:59:16	swivel	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise#Implementation
2019-11-26 11:01:00	 *	EvanR clicks to get the answer that swivel apparently doesn't know yet
2019-11-26 11:01:33	swivel	if I understood the precise bounds I'd already have my scaling factor perfected
2019-11-26 11:01:39	swivel	and wouldn't be talking about it
2019-11-26 11:01:44	swivel	but the numbers are small.
2019-11-26 11:01:51	EvanR	ballpark would be fine, just curious
2019-11-26 11:01:54	swivel	because it's perlin noise
2019-11-26 11:02:45	swivel	less than 1
2019-11-26 11:02:53	EvanR	-inf to 1 ?
2019-11-26 11:03:12	swivel	no
2019-11-26 11:03:32	EvanR	you're trying to go from [0,1] to [-1,1] ?
2019-11-26 11:04:01	swivel	I think the problem is it's not quite up to 1
2019-11-26 11:04:15	swivel	because perlin noise is basically interpolated derivatives
2019-11-26 11:09:01	EvanR	i like the extern in the middle of the example
2019-11-26 11:09:09	swivel	it might be tricky, like it depends on the randomized crap in the nodes the algorithm is sampling, hence no fixed scaling factor
2019-11-26 11:09:41	swivel	if the derivatives are all low for a given set of nodes, you'd need more scaling to get it filled out -1..+1 on the minimax
2019-11-26 11:10:16	swivel	*shrug*
2019-11-26 11:11:18	EvanR	that explains it
2019-11-26 11:11:21	swivel	perhaps it's misguided to expect such output, it's not exactly a random number generator.
2019-11-26 11:12:08	EvanR	the output depends on the range of gradients, which is unrelated to the range of input data itself
2019-11-26 11:13:10	EvanR	i'll say that knowing the bounds of derivatives is very useful in constructive analysis and hense algorithms we expect to work
2019-11-26 11:13:20	swivel	the input data is just randomized unit vectors
2019-11-26 11:13:44	EvanR	well, a random field of unit vectors can have unbounded derivatives
2019-11-26 11:14:10	swivel	that's why it dots them :)
2019-11-26 11:15:22	swivel	it dots those with the distance vector from the point being sampled between the surrounding nodes' unit vectors
2019-11-26 11:16:20	swivel	so it seems entirely bounded
2019-11-26 11:16:55	EvanR	i see it dots a vector into the square with the gradiant at a corner
2019-11-26 11:17:26	EvanR	non sequitor about bounding a random gradient though
2019-11-26 11:18:20	swivel	neither of these lengths is > 1
2019-11-26 11:19:03	EvanR	grid spacing is 1, if input Gradient is at most length <1,1> then yeah there's bounds. [-sqrt2,sqrt2]
2019-11-26 11:19:21	EvanR	for the dotGradient function
2019-11-26 11:21:10	EvanR	(i only recently groked a revelation, if you use floats in the range 0 to 1... you are effectively covering a range near zero with unlimited extra precision... which only ends at the "subnormal", and stuff near there acts different! brain explode)
2019-11-26 11:21:34	EvanR	arithemetic from 1 to 2 on the other hand acts more like integers
2019-11-26 11:21:39	EvanR	or 2 to 4
2019-11-26 11:23:30	EvanR	back to your bounds, since vector into the grid can never reach <1,1> exactly, and given max gradient, the dot is less than max gradient
2019-11-26 11:24:54	EvanR	(gradient <1,1> was wrong... i meant 1/sqrt2 <1,1>
2019-11-26 11:26:38	EvanR	... vector into a 1x1 square can be length > 1    man i'm off today
2019-11-26 11:28:06	swivel	looking at libnoise source:
2019-11-26 11:28:11	swivel	    /// This noise module outputs Perlin-noise values that usually range from
2019-11-26 11:28:11	swivel	    /// -1.0 to +1.0, but there are no guarantees that all output values will
2019-11-26 11:28:11	swivel	    /// exist within that range.
2019-11-26 11:28:33	EvanR	lovely
2019-11-26 11:28:47	EvanR	does that mean it goes out of range? lol
2019-11-26 11:29:42	swivel	hey man, Ken Perlin won an Oscar for this invention :)
2019-11-26 11:31:17	EvanR	at any point, you can haul out interval analysis. If the input data is in range foo bar, and baz quux, each basic float operation outputs a well defined new interval, probably 'worse' (larger than original, possibly splitting in case of division)
2019-11-26 11:32:25	EvanR	also works for vector ops

2019-11-26 11:34:00	swivel	i just wanted to ensure my perlin samples were from -1..+1 so I could scale them to 2*PI radians and let the noise steer my meta balls around with the full range of directions
2019-11-26 11:34:28	EvanR	understandable
2019-11-26 11:34:45	EvanR	"know thy range"
2019-11-26 11:35:15	swivel	i had already plugged it in assuming that was the case and they kept congregating on the right edge of the screen
2019-11-26 11:35:54	swivel	so now I'm just scaling it by 10 first and that seems to have spread out the directions enough
2019-11-26 11:36:08	swivel	feels gross
2019-11-26 11:36:20	EvanR	well if you have perlin noise from -1 to 1, and map that to 0,2pi... that seems like you have values congregating around pi
2019-11-26 11:36:48	swivel	that's true
2019-11-26 11:37:28	EvanR	no matter what direction pi is... that's some direction! :)
2019-11-26 11:37:40	swivel	i hadn't appreciated how it's not giving me a uniform distribution of random numbers between -1..+1 that just follow a continuous noisy pattern
2019-11-26 11:38:19	EvanR	that's an interesting spinoff problem
2019-11-26 11:38:46	swivel	in testing the range of outputs i sampled the whole cube of and threw all the results in a histogram, it the counts concentrate in the middle like a gaussian distribution
2019-11-26 11:38:56	EvanR	"gimme some random signal that is not total noise, but is uniform over time in some range"
2019-11-26 11:39:26	swivel	yeah... that's what I was lookgin for, perlin isn't really the right thing
2019-11-26 11:39:41	swivel	maybe i should just be smoothing rand()
2019-11-26 11:40:34	EvanR	do you want your metaballs to follow a random walk around 0 ?
2019-11-26 11:40:44	swivel	yeah more or less
2019-11-26 11:40:59	EvanR	like playing a vegas game at break even
2019-11-26 11:41:36	swivel	it kind of works as-is, but it's not ideal
2019-11-26 11:41:48	swivel	and perlin isn't exactly cheap either
2019-11-26 11:43:07	EvanR	you can do that by having it's velocity be periodically jolted by a 'unit amount' in a random direction
2019-11-26 11:43:22	EvanR	i.e. brownian motion
2019-11-26 11:44:45	EvanR	true brownian motion also changes the 'periodically' to 'poissonian' and 'unit amount' to 'boltzmannian', but same idea
2019-11-26 11:45:08	swivel	i'll look into brownian motion tomorrow
2019-11-26 11:45:14	swivel	bedtime soon
2019-11-26 11:45:17	EvanR	a discrete random walk would just be choosing a random direction to walk even time step
2019-11-26 11:45:24	EvanR	every*
2019-11-26 11:45:53	EvanR	the result is they are around the starting point on average
2019-11-26 11:46:22	swivel	before i went down the perlin rabbithole i was just calling rand and bumping their positions by a fraction of that
2019-11-26 11:46:30	swivel	but they were just jittery
2019-11-26 11:46:58	swivel	i wanted them to kind of drift around and stick to trajectories for varying amounts of time
2019-11-26 11:47:49	swivel	so instead i sample the perlin noise at coordinates derived from the metaball positions and adjust their positions with cos/sin of what comes out
2019-11-26 11:48:08	swivel	since the perlin noise is continous that produces some nice drifting around movements
2019-11-26 11:51:47	swivel	anyhow, bedtime
2019-11-26 11:51:54	swivel	EvanR: thanks for the help!
2019-11-26 11:52:40	EvanR	np
2019-11-26 11:52:46	EvanR	i'll think on that
2019-11-26 11:53:24	swivel	the code is accessible if it's something you're interested in playing with...
2019-11-26 11:54:57	swivel	git://git.pengaru.com/rototiller  under src/modules/meta2d  and the perlin noise code is in src/libs/din/  fyi.
2019-11-26 11:56:26	EvanR	man
2019-11-26 11:57:58	EvanR	4 decades of demoscene code is just sitting out there, with zillions of such algorithms to make stuff "floaty around"... lost to history :)
2019-11-26 11:57:58	EvanR	or do more interesting motions

2019-11-27 16:54:03	J_L_P	it's destined to fail though
2019-11-27 16:54:14	Xeek	well they probably allready appropriated the money for the ads before it came out that it kinda sucks :D
2019-11-27 16:55:24	qeed_	who cares google has like 100 dead projects

2019-11-27 16:56:05	qeed_	they think they can solve all their problems with machine learning or some bullshite
2019-11-27 16:56:19	Xeek	lol I dont believe you, my last company did screen sharing technology, its nothing near that
2019-11-27 16:56:26	Xeek	and we used Googles' VP9
2019-11-27 16:57:22	Xeek	it's going to be comparable to watching YouTube
2019-11-27 16:57:46	Xeek	10mbps for 720p, 20mbps for 1080p...
2019-11-27 16:58:43	J_L_P	Xeek -->  https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/google-stadia-bandwidth-data-use-data-plan/
2019-11-27 16:59:22	Xeek	its not that surprising
2019-11-27 17:00:57	Xeek	They're just streaming snapshots of the game to your device, basically the same as weatching YouTube, and I highly doubt they went with a different codec than their own Vp9 which is already really good for this sort of stuff.
2019-11-27 17:02:12	Xeek	you're going to eat through gigabytes an hour :D
2019-11-27 17:03:09	Xeek	do they say at what setting? 10GB/hr sounds like 4k
2019-11-27 17:03:44	J_L_P	yes, I was wrong - 10GB/hour is for 4k
2019-11-27 17:03:56	Xeek	thats identical to youtube watching
2019-11-27 17:04:16	Xeek	I don't watch video on my data plan, I wait for WiFi :D

2019-12-04 10:50:00	fogobogo	i was knee deep in the dea... doom mods. what an interesting scene. very vibrant
2019-12-04 10:51:15	fogobogo	also discovered doom really plays like no other fps these days. its a lot faster with a higher body count

2019-12-04 11:00:22	fogobogo	good time getting back to it, it seems. some tillitating stuff came out lately

2019-12-04 11:02:58	swivel	url?
2019-12-04 11:05:48	fogobogo	from what i gathered the most action is on the zdoom forums as well as the doomworld forums. zandronum too if you are into multiplayer
2019-12-04 11:06:51	fogobogo	doomworld also has the cacowards for the best stuff by year
2019-12-04 11:07:16	fogobogo	i'd go for the newer ones as the 90's stuff really isn't that great
2019-12-04 11:07:34	fogobogo	moddb is a good choice for anything brutal
2019-12-04 11:08:39	swivel	is there a particular mod you have in mind when describing as titilating I should try first?
2019-12-04 11:08:55	fogobogo	well thats currently really hot https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/103425-final-release-eviternity/
2019-12-04 11:09:29	fogobogo	avactor is really impressive too https://www.doomworld.com/cacowards/2018/best1/
2019-12-04 11:10:10	swivel	thanks :)
2019-12-04 11:10:11	fogobogo	and you can mix and match that with other stuff as well. nashgore is a good one if you want some blood fountains

2019-12-04 11:12:56	swivel	you too, ttyl
2019-12-04 11:30:16	EvanR	fogobogo: i started a 'difficulty: realism' with 'tactical' mode in brutal doom, it's pretty crazy
2019-12-04 11:30:30	EvanR	you don't zoom around super fast, unless you actually run
2019-12-04 11:30:36	EvanR	then you are insanely fast
2019-12-04 11:30:39	EvanR	but it runs out
2019-12-04 11:30:46	EvanR	also you can't shoot while running
2019-12-04 11:31:39	EvanR	the realism part is... weapons are effectively very deadly, explosions should be viewed from a safe distance
2019-12-04 11:32:00	EvanR	i also just found out about brutal doom 64. Holy crap, doom 64 is scary as hell
2019-12-04 11:32:28	EvanR	also holy crap multiplayer is insanely working with zandorum + doomseeker
2019-12-04 11:32:33	EvanR	how is doom so alive right now
2019-12-04 11:33:42	demonicmaniac3	probably because doom 2016 and ion fury and such
2019-12-04 11:33:50	demonicmaniac3	all the build engine remakes coming out too
2019-12-04 11:33:56	EvanR	thing is, brutal doom predates doom 2016
2019-12-04 11:34:07	EvanR	i have a distinct feeling they fed off each other
2019-12-04 11:35:46	EvanR	i like how the "community" has basically decided the chronology is doom, doom II, doom 64, doom 2016  (doom 3, i.e. black screen simulator, shall not be spoken of)
2019-12-04 11:38:22	demonicmaniac3	i like doom3 but as what dead space should have been not as doom
2019-12-04 11:40:59	EvanR	i hated it
2019-12-04 11:41:27	EvanR	for whatever reason i couldn't shoot anything. It happens to me in select FPS, my shots always miss in some but not others
2019-12-04 11:41:42	EvanR	the whole being in the dark the whole time didn't help
2019-12-04 11:42:28	demonicmaniac3	well that's the thing doom3 is predominately "horror" in the alien way or all the dead spaces after, it's not a shooter per se thus not doom

2019-12-04 12:13:12	fogobogo	yeah, it really is a bit meh. watched some gameplay of it
2019-12-04 12:24:05	EvanR	fogobogo: what has happened here... i wanted to see what was in this .wad file, so i renamed it to .zip and tried to extract with finder, it says unsupported format!
2019-12-04 12:24:30	EvanR	i thought wads were zips. Has something happened in the intervening 25 years

2019-12-04 12:39:47	EvanR	everything i know is wrong
2019-12-04 12:40:06	EvanR	very doom
2019-12-04 12:44:41	fogobogo	EvanR: it really is pretty crazy how doom still has that much of community around it.
2019-12-04 12:45:15	EvanR	in 2004ish i was pretty sure i was the last person on earth who cared about doom
2019-12-04 12:45:27	fogobogo	i was looking some other staple fps's like quake, duke3d and such but it pales in comparsion
2019-12-04 12:46:09	fogobogo	clearly something happened. the community output is staggering atm
2019-12-04 12:47:12	EvanR	we can make an incomplete-but-great intermission text about it
2019-12-04 12:47:42	EvanR	The doom craze finally died out and earth recovered as best it could given the circumstances
2019-12-04 12:48:35	fogobogo	ever seen the clusterfuck addon in action? think it only runs with zandronum
2019-12-04 12:48:38	EvanR	but <insert some vague description> happened and reanimated every doom fan who ever existed, their children, and their dog. Hell returned
2019-12-04 12:49:01	fogobogo	lol
2019-12-04 12:50:54	fogobogo	uac ultra is a pretty good mapset btw
2019-12-04 12:51:05	fogobogo	thats also pretty impressive https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=55298
2019-12-04 12:52:43	EvanR	i'm playing ultimate doom and doom 2 right now with brutal doom
2019-12-04 12:53:03	EvanR	not sure if i'm going to continue with brutal doom 64
2019-12-04 12:53:10	fogobogo	tbh, theres way, way better levels than the doom ones
2019-12-04 12:53:16	EvanR	yeah i figured
2019-12-04 12:53:33	EvanR	i made a few terrible levels way back in the day
2019-12-04 12:54:01	fogobogo	"doom the way id did it" or "no end in sight" you'll hardly know the difference
2019-12-04 12:54:25	EvanR	are thos map pack names or
2019-12-04 12:56:20	EvanR	did freedoom ever get finished?
2019-12-04 12:56:34	EvanR	i kept checking on it and they had more levels and more creatures but
2019-12-04 12:56:48	EvanR	with all this output you'd think it would be totally done

2019-12-10 09:45:42	fogobogo	way it is that struct only lives as long as that function runs and i'd need to be awfully precise to input something at that very same moment
2019-12-10 09:51:33	joakim12	I'm trying to implement a menu for C++ program that uses SDL2. I have no other ideas how to implement it.
2019-12-10 09:53:51	fogobogo	ever heard of scope?
2019-12-10 09:54:09	joakim12	I have.
2019-12-10 09:55:17	fogobogo	yeah. so, i think thats the problem there. now move that SDL_Event out of the int falafel or whatever and make it a class member or whatever. then try again

2019-12-10 09:58:09	swivel	what's wrong with the scope?
2019-12-10 09:58:21	swivel	not that this c++ code is particularly clean or readable
2019-12-10 09:59:12	fogobogo	i guess the event pointer is zapped before the rest gets a chance to keep up
2019-12-10 10:00:50	swivel	but isn't the event struct valid for the whole valja() function there?
2019-12-10 10:01:32	swivel	it's not like the function is returning a pointer to the local event struct or something
2019-12-10 10:02:15	swivel	joakim12: i don't get why you're using pollevent here
2019-12-10 10:05:29	joakim12	I'm trying to make a menu for my program. I print the labels and check with SDL_PollEvent in function valja() to get the choise user clicks on. Print a menu and check on what menu item the user presses SDL_BUTTON_LEFT
2019-12-10 10:07:21	fogobogo	ah, but events kinda work odd
2019-12-10 10:08:09	joakim12	One SDL_PollEvent is for main loop and other one I for calss Menu to check for event SDL_BUTTON_LEFT.
2019-12-10 10:08:12	swivel	joakim12: is the event you're triggering calling manu.valja() on the event you want the menu to handle?
2019-12-10 10:10:03	swivel	joakim12: the problem is pollevent doesn't synchronize with the user clicking anything
2019-12-10 10:11:13	swivel	joakim12: it *polls* for events, so when your main loop seesn SDL_BUTTON_RIGHT, it immediately calls menu.valja() which *immediately* polls for another event and finds *nothing* because the user isn't going to be clicking fast enough to beat the CPU immediately polling
2019-12-10 10:11:53	joakim12	I tried to use SDL_WaitEvent and it did not work too.

2019-12-10 10:14:28	joakim12	Okey. Now WaitEvent outputs 1 one means there is a pending event.
2019-12-10 10:17:13	swivel	joakim12: do you want menu.valja() to take over the main loop until a menu choice is made?
2019-12-10 10:18:30	joakim12	I user menu one time. Print it, check for user mouse click and return i wich is the button user clicked on.
2019-12-10 10:19:22	swivel	joakim12: so you want menu.valja() to not reutrn until a menu item is selected?
2019-12-10 10:19:37	swivel	joakim12: you need to put a loop in menu.valja() around your pollevent, similar to your main event loop.
2019-12-10 10:19:38	joakim12	Yes.
2019-12-10 10:20:29	swivel	This architecture is generally bad, but just sticking an event loop in menu.valja() should get you closer to something working I guess
2019-12-10 10:31:28	joakim12	I put the PollEvent in the loop and the loop does not enter.
2019-12-10 10:37:54	joakim12	Every game has this kind of menu. First menu pop up, then user selects a menu item and then the program returns form menu with the right number of chise.

2019-12-10 10:48:08	swivel	joakim12: I'm talking about the software architecture, not the concept
2019-12-10 10:48:58	swivel	joakim12: if your menu class takes over the event loop whenever there's interaction with the menu, then your main loop is blocked until the interaction completes.
2019-12-10 10:49:33	swivel	joakim12: so your main loop can't do other useful things like draw on the screen, service timers, handle other non-menu-related events, etc.
2019-12-10 10:50:03	swivel	joakim12: I don't get the impression you've really thought much about how this is supposed to all work together
2019-12-10 10:58:52	joakim12	Is it the concept of non-blocking input?
2019-12-10 11:02:15	joakim12	Am i approaching the wrong way to this idea?
2019-12-10 11:03:25	swivel	joakim12: I think you need to just think a bit more about how the pieces should work together and what your long-term goal is
2019-12-10 11:04:52	joakim12	For now I'm just tryig to make the menu to work and from there on I have some ideas.
2019-12-10 11:05:27	swivel	joakim12: maybe it makes sense for your main event loop to support dynamically registered event handlers, so when say the menu gets activated with right click, the menu installs a persistent event handler that calls into the menu class supplying the event struct populated by the main event loop
2019-12-10 11:05:41	joakim12	I'm a newbie to C++ and SDL and OpenGL.
2019-12-10 11:06:17	swivel	joakim12: then when a menu choice is made and the menu goes away, it unregisters its event handler so the main loop stops calling into the menu class on events
2019-12-10 11:07:31	swivel	just one idea which i think would work better than what you've got right now...

2019-12-11 15:43:30	Cyp_	Ok, thanks. How weird…
2019-12-11 15:44:01	EvanR	it might have been too difficult or impossible to implement for some or most of the formats
2019-12-11 15:44:41	Cyp_	So functions like Mix_FadeInMusicPos and Mix_FadeOutMusic are useless for fading out and then resuming at the same spot. And there's no Mix_FadeOutMusicWithoutLosingPosition.
2019-12-11 15:45:30	EvanR	you want to fade out music, pause, resume, and fade in?
2019-12-11 15:46:21	EvanR	i guess if you want to switch to another song in the mean time, SDL_Mixer can't do it
2019-12-11 15:46:50	EvanR	libmikmod however can. Each playing song is an object that remembers it's location, like a casset tape
2019-12-11 15:47:37	EvanR	also note if you use Mixer's music hook feature, you can implement whatever functionality you want
