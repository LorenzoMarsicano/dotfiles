2019-09-13 14:51:42	reduz	so at least now I have nice roadmap for the weekend, make this demo work again perfectly
2019-09-13 14:54:40	Groud	You're close to be done :)
2019-09-13 14:56:31	reduz	i want to think that, but still missing so much
2019-09-13 14:57:24	reduz	the last three difficult parts will be GI Probes (which will need to work different), lightmapping (which also needs to work different, and based on jfons work), and particles (yet again, will work different)
2019-09-13 14:58:36	reduz	and next week I need to fix skinning in Godot 3.x so the guys can keep improving things
2019-09-13 14:59:19	reduz	so that leaves me with less than around 3 weeks to do that, which is probably not as much
2019-09-13 14:59:38	reduz	I will try to get GIProbes to work at least so we can have something looking nice for Poland
2019-09-13 14:59:56	Groud	that would be good :)

2019-10-22 09:09:16	eoinoneill[m]	So this is a bit of a technical question that I'm curious about. I've been making my own implementation of something similar to a rts tile map system into godot as an EditorPlugin and was curious to how other godot devs would go about instancing each individual 'tile'. I noticed things like the tilemap and the 3d gridmap don't use child nodes to render out the contents of the tiles. How exactly is something
2019-10-22 09:09:17	eoinoneill[m]	like this achieved in a way that also makes use of instancing? I imagine it directly interfaces with the VisualServer to register each tile once and then calls directly into it to render?
2019-10-22 09:09:32	eoinoneill[m]	If anybody has a specific function / class I can refer to in the C++ code, that could also be useful.
2019-10-22 09:33:19	Groud	For tilemap like things, yes, you should likely use the draw functions of canvas items
2019-10-22 09:33:20	Groud	It's more or less direct calls to the visual server

2019-10-24 11:13:36	Akien	Let's paint this shed together :) #33027
2019-10-24 11:13:37	IssueBot	#33027: Upcoming C++ code style changes for 4.0+ | https://git.io/Je0ab
2019-10-24 11:23:39	RevoluPowered	is the clang format already updated to do this stuff?
2019-10-24 11:23:41	Groud	Akien: Godd ideas there :)
2019-10-24 11:23:48	Groud	good*
2019-10-24 11:24:51	Akien	RevoluPowered: > 4.0+\
2019-10-24 11:25:00	RevoluPowered	ah okay
2019-10-24 11:25:06	RevoluPowered	that's good then :D
2019-10-24 11:26:42	RevoluPowered	sorry still waking up caffine is taking time to work
2019-10-24 11:26:43	RevoluPowered	lol
2019-10-24 11:28:53	Akien	I'm itching to do these changes now, but it would make rebasing the vulkan branch a huge PITA, so best wait :)
2019-10-24 11:29:32	RevoluPowered	I might wait until 4.0 for unit testing branch because we need to mess with main()
2019-10-24 11:29:38	RevoluPowered	might make your life harder is what I mean
2019-10-24 11:29:41	homer666	nice that these things have been decided before they could actually become habits of mine
2019-10-24 11:30:00	RevoluPowered	I think @reduz was going to help me out with that to make it less painful
2019-10-24 11:30:26	homer666	ive been forcing myself to do the "empty line after opening brace" thing since that's how the godot codebase does it but it's far from a habit at this point and i can safely dispose of it
2019-10-24 11:31:27	RevoluPowered	another thing which the unit testing --test command line adds is that it will block any arguments after --test and past them into doctest so we will need to document this
2019-10-24 11:31:48	RevoluPowered	as people might want to use doctest arguments to run specific tests, or we can wrap what they will need cleanly
2019-10-24 11:33:22	Groud	Akien: I think the code style looks great, but it should be checkable via clang-format
2019-10-24 11:34:07	Groud	Otherwise, I don't see myself checking PRs for style issues and asking for style changes.
2019-10-24 11:34:10	homer666	Akien: method parameters prefixed with `r_` refer to references, i thought
2019-10-24 11:34:54	Groud	homer666: yes, that is what the document say
2019-10-24 11:34:59	Groud	the issue*
2019-10-24 11:35:43	homer666	in the issue Akien says he doesn't know what the proper term for those kinds of parameters are
2019-10-24 11:36:24	Groud	Ah indeed,
2019-10-24 11:36:37	Groud	yeah those are usually used for reference
2019-10-24 11:36:47	Akien	Sometimes it's pointers though
2019-10-24 11:37:01	homer666	uh oh
2019-10-24 11:37:09	Groud	typically for parameters like `bool &r_mybool`
2019-10-24 11:37:26	Akien	And some parameters are often passed by referenced but not modified, e.g. Strings
2019-10-24 11:37:38	Akien	`const String &p_name`
2019-10-24 11:37:45	Groud	hmm
2019-10-24 11:37:56	homer666	im sure reduz will have a really good answer for this
2019-10-24 11:38:00	homer666	r-right??
2019-10-24 11:38:08	Groud	maybe r_ as return makes sense then

2019-10-24 11:51:19	Akien	Another thing I'd like to make more consistent is the ordering of method declarations in .cpp files, especially in Nodes
2019-10-24 11:51:58	Akien	Currently we loosely follow an unwritten convention to have `_bind_methods` towards the end, followed by the constructor and destructor if there are any.
2019-10-24 11:52:16	Akien	Both sometimes people put other public or private methods after `_bind_methods` or after the constructor.
2019-10-24 11:52:28	Akien	And anything before `_bind_methods` is just free for all, there's no real consistency.
2019-10-24 11:52:44	Akien	(Apart maybe from starting with `_notification`)
2019-10-24 11:54:50	Groud	ah yeah
2019-10-24 11:54:54	Groud	that would make sense

2019-10-24 11:58:00	Akien	I guess to figure out a convention for this we should aim to make node.cpp/h perfectly formatted, and then derive conventions from that.

2019-10-24 14:49:47	Calinou	I try to wrap my lines around 100 characters, but not everyone does so :)
2019-10-24 14:52:50	Akien	Calinou: yes, with ColumnLimit. But in my experience it always leads to very ugly looking code.
2019-10-24 14:52:55	Akien	What's the difference between a soft and hard limit?
2019-10-24 14:53:11	Calinou	soft limit is the limit people try to follow, but they can go up to the hard limit if it's not convenient or too ugly
2019-10-24 14:53:38	Calinou	I use soft wrapping personally, but it's not as good as hard wrapping when it comes to code
2019-10-24 14:53:54	Akien	See e.g. editor_node.cpp with ColumnLimit: 120: https://hastebin.com/iweqemaqic
2019-10-24 14:54:24	Akien	This kind of wrapping doesn't make much sense IMO and things are harder to parse visually.
2019-10-24 14:54:49	Akien	Hard wrapping works well if you use spaces for indentation and then spaces for alignment, but if you use tabs for indentation and you don't allow spaces for alignment, it looks ugly.
2019-10-24 14:55:26	Calinou	I also don't like how clang-format puts the closing parenthesis on the same line when wrapping lines, I generally don't do that in other languages
2019-10-24 14:55:33	Akien	Like this make really no sense:
2019-10-24 14:55:34	Akien	        String edited =
2019-10-24 14:55:34	Akien	                        editor_data.get_edited_scene_root() ? editor_data.get_edited_scene_root()->get_filename() : String();
2019-10-24 14:56:13	Akien	Or this:
2019-10-24 14:56:14	Akien	                        scene_root->set_size_override(
2019-10-24 14:56:14	Akien	                                        true, Size2(ProjectSettings::get_singleton()->get("display/window/size/width"),
2019-10-24 14:56:14	Akien	                                                                  ProjectSettings::get_singleton()->get("display/window/size/height")));
2019-10-24 14:56:29	Akien	The last line even has 2 spaces of alignment after its double tab indent
2019-10-24 14:56:52	Akien	To make it 2 tabs worth of indent after `Size2(`
2019-10-24 14:58:08	Akien	If you find ways to configure it so that it's not terrible, we can consider it though :)
2019-10-24 14:58:18	Calinou	yeah, I guess doing it manually is still the way to go then
2019-10-24 14:58:48	Calinou	also, what about macro usage? Since we're doing formatting changes, what about replacing all uses of ProjectSettings::get_singleton()->get() with GLOBAL_GET?
2019-10-24 14:58:50	Akien	Even manually doesn't work so well as clang-format is opinionated (as it should be), so it will often revert your changes to whatever it would have done itself.
2019-10-24 14:58:59	thenameipicked[m	I'm looking at the code style guidelines:  Should I be #including files that I directly use even if they are included by other includes?
2019-10-24 14:59:42	Akien	thenameipicked[m: Yes, otherwise your code will break if those other includes are removed or changed
2019-10-24 15:00:04	Akien	We'll soon apply https://include-what-you-use.org/ on the codebase to ensure that everything includes their direct dependencies.
2019-10-24 15:07:50	Groud	That would be really great

2019-10-24 17:48:13	Calinou	the main issue I have is making sure buttons are easily distinguished from the background in all situations
2019-10-24 17:48:22	reduz	Calinou: we should probably move a lot of the core editor theme to make it the core engine theme at some point
2019-10-24 17:48:24	Calinou	I'll try to PR it soon-ish so we can discuss it
2019-10-24 17:48:43	Calinou	that too, we could also move to a DynamicFont for the default project font so that oversampling works out of the box
2019-10-24 17:48:48	Calinou	(good for prototyping)
2019-10-24 17:49:00	Calinou	of course, we'd have to keep the charset relatively low as to not bloat binaries
2019-10-24 17:49:20	Calinou	right now, Godot binaries embed the default project font in two sizes (lodpi and hidpi)
2019-10-24 17:49:42	Calinou	we can bundle a single DynamicFont instead, it should be about the same size depending on the character set included

2019-10-25 11:38:13	IssueBot	#33058: Mesh fails to render material with non power of 2 textures [WebGL 2.0] | https://git.io/Je0AV
2019-10-25 11:38:45	Akien	reduz: See last comment, the problem is that on WebGL 2.0 we use S3TC for which we don't resize to po2 contrarily to the other formats, as it's not needed on OpenGL/PC
2019-10-25 11:39:47	Akien	On GLES2/WebGL 1.0 it's fine as we perform resize on the fly in the rasterizer itself when needed, but not for GLES3.
2019-10-25 11:39:49	reduz	Akien: i think i already added resizing to po2 in those platforms
2019-10-25 11:40:14	reduz	oh for webgl2
2019-10-25 11:40:24	Akien	You added resize to po2 on import for ETC, ETC2 and PVRTC, and on load in rasterizer for GLES2
2019-10-25 11:40:28	reduz	i am not sure if much can be done, maybe just decompress and resize the texture
2019-10-25 11:40:32	reduz	not super efficient
2019-10-25 11:40:48	Akien	So should I port the GLES2 code that does that to GLES3?
2019-10-25 11:41:12	reduz	Akien: maybe, i am not quite sure if it will work in GLES3
2019-10-25 11:41:37	Akien	The alternative I guess would be to import textures as s3tc_web.stex and use those for Web export (with po2 resize)
2019-10-25 11:41:50	Akien	But that means one more import format

2019-10-25 12:00:08	Akien	Nice :)
2019-10-25 12:00:17	Akien	I ported the decompress and resize code from gles2 to gles3, let's see if it works.
2019-10-25 12:01:31	Akien	That's actually a situation that we could solve if we add support for importing assets on export based on the export preset's config
2019-10-25 12:01:47	Akien	The HTML5 preset could enforce S3TC with resize to po2

2019-10-25 12:46:59	Akien	You say the problem is npot compressed, so maybe I can have a WEBGL ifdef that just uncompresses, but does not resize? Would that be sufficient?
2019-10-25 12:47:16	reduz	yes
2019-10-25 12:47:45	Akien	Though I think the better solution is likely to export compressed and resized S3TC for WebGL. That would avoid wasting memory when decompressing.

2019-10-25 13:15:59	Jummit	I am making a custom module for cleaning up html using tidy, but I get this error when building: `undefined reference to `tidyCreate'`
2019-10-25 13:16:12	Jummit	This seems to be a linking problem (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44902138/undefined-reference-errors-while-using-tidy-library-especially-tidy-h)
2019-10-25 13:16:24	Jummit	How do I go about fixing this?
2019-10-25 13:16:59	Akien	You pass -ltidy to the linker, likely via `env.Append(LIBS=["tidy"])`
2019-10-25 13:17:12	Akien	http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/cpp/binding_to_external_libraries.html
2019-10-25 13:19:00	Jummit	Can I use a cloned env  (env.Clone()) for that? What would be the difference?
2019-10-25 13:19:59	Akien	You can't for that, as it needs to be linked with the final Godot binary, so in the main env
2019-10-25 13:21:27	Jummit	That's probably the issue. I used a cloned env.
2019-10-25 13:24:11	Akien	You can (should) use a clone env for everything else though
2019-10-25 13:24:15	Akien	It's only for LIBS that you should use env
2019-10-25 13:24:47	Akien	The docs I linked are probably wrong btw
2019-10-25 13:35:21	Jummit	Should I also use the global env for LIBPATH and CPPPATH appends and add_source_files calls?
2019-10-25 13:36:35	Jummit	Oops, I didn't read your reply.
2019-10-25 13:50:04	Jummit	It gives me `/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -ltidycollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status`

2019-10-25 13:51:27	Akien	Seems like tidy depends on tidycollect2, so you need both

2019-10-25 13:52:10	Jummit	`collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status`
2019-10-25 13:53:11	Akien	Is there `libtidy.so` in tidy-html5/build/cmake ?
2019-10-25 13:53:31	Jummit	Yep
2019-10-25 13:54:10	Akien	env_tts.Append(LIBPATH=['tidy-html5/build/cmake']) should also be on `env`
2019-10-25 13:54:20	Akien	Otherwise `env` doesn't know about this LIBPATH
2019-10-25 13:54:24	Jummit	Ok, I'll try it.

2019-10-25 13:56:20	Jummit	Aah, thats right.
2019-10-25 13:56:34	Akien	Like `#modules/tidy/tidy-html5/build/cmake` if that's where it is

2019-10-25 14:50:13	Jummit	Why does this work: `godot --path /path/to/project Main.tscn`, but putting this in launch.json in vscode gives me errors: ```"args": ["--path /path/to/project Main.tscn"]```
2019-10-25 14:50:45	Jummit	The error is `Cannot open file 'res://Main.tscn`

2019-10-25 14:51:35	iFire	maybe that?
2019-10-25 14:51:40	iFire	fix the whitespace
2019-10-25 14:52:40	Jummit	Nope, dosn't work.

2019-10-25 14:54:30	iFire	Good morning
2019-10-25 14:57:07	RevoluPowered	@reduz in like 2-3 hours could we look at the issue I was working on that I mentioned yesterday?
2019-10-25 14:57:32	Jummit	Thanks iFire, it did work after separating --path from path/to/project
2019-10-25 14:58:41	reduz	RevoluPowered: alright
2019-10-25 14:59:04	RevoluPowered	cool, I appreciate your help :)
2019-10-25 14:59:12	RevoluPowered	nerdflu appears gone
2019-10-25 15:01:02	iFire	https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/32766 is pretty big, it might confuse our issue :/
2019-10-25 15:03:56	RevoluPowered	can someone please try disabling the make_dirty call on the skins to see if the make dirty call is causing the cache from the  tscn to be invalidated or overwritten?
2019-10-25 15:04:17	RevoluPowered	I will take a look in an hour but thought that could possibly be it
2019-10-25 15:06:04	reduz	i have to rewrite all the code to get textures back from vulkan because spec sucks
2019-10-25 15:06:27	RevoluPowered	man, that sucks what does that entail?
2019-10-25 15:06:51	reduz	replacing images in CPU using linear format to buffers and use vkCmdCopyImageToBuffer
2019-10-25 15:08:55	reduz	well, it may not be that much effort
2019-10-25 15:10:09	RevoluPowered	it's still a pain in the <badwords> having to change the code every time for regressions though, feel your pain had the same issues with convert clusters
2019-10-25 15:12:51	thenameipicked[m	Can I get a review of this PR: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/32557  Since last time, I've added docs, tested it, and cleaned up my code a bunch, so I think I'm somewhat close.
2019-10-25 15:14:03	iFire	thenameipicked[m: can you reduce the number of commits
2019-10-25 15:14:33	thenameipicked[m	Sure:  how do I do that?
2019-10-25 15:14:38	iFire	thenameipicked[m:  is there a test project / demo for your pr?
2019-10-25 15:14:43	thenameipicked[m	do I need to make a separate PR?
2019-10-25 15:14:57	iFire	https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/contributing/pr_workflow.html
2019-10-25 15:15:02	iFire	you can use the same pr
2019-10-25 15:16:18	thenameipicked[m	Does github not automatically squash commits?
2019-10-25 15:16:52	Calinou	it can, but we don't use that feature because it looks messy
2019-10-25 15:17:00	Calinou	due to this, we prefer that people squash commits on their own :)
2019-10-25 15:17:42	thenameipicked[m	Ok.  I've been testing the code on my personal project:  but I can easily whip up a test project somewhere.  Where should I stick it?
2019-10-25 15:18:09	iFire	The idea place is in the godot asset samples, but that doesn't have a maintainer
2019-10-25 15:18:11	iFire	ideal*
2019-10-25 15:18:31	iFire	so just a github repository would work and then you can think about submitting it later
2019-10-25 15:20:42	Calinou	I could step up as a godot-demo-projects maintainer (https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/172) but I don't have much more time for stuff really
2019-10-25 15:20:59	Calinou	even if it doesn't require that much time, I already feel like I'm spreading myself too thin
2019-10-25 15:21:35	iFire	Calinou: I think we should grow the community rather than spreading thinner
2019-10-25 15:22:17	Calinou	our efforts have been vain so far :(

2019-10-25 16:06:46	reduz	iFire: ask me if you need things (you will probably do), but the first you will need to do is manage to get an HDR swapchain via extension

2019-10-25 16:16:29	reduz	iFire: also do you have an hdr display?
2019-10-25 16:17:10	iFire	not yet. I have a high gamut display
2019-10-25 16:17:23	iFire	so it's not srgb but adobe rgb
2019-10-25 16:17:40	iFire	so it still has the icc profile problem

2019-10-25 16:19:44	iFire	however the tvs are more hdr compatible, but they are not in 32" format maybe 42" format and are premium priced
2019-10-25 16:19:57	iFire	and I can't use them as a daily monitor
2019-10-25 16:21:49	iFire	will see how krita does their hdr painting support
2019-10-25 16:22:50	iFire	The idea displays is https://www.apple.com/ca/pro-display-xdr/ or something from vizo, but no one has that money or hardware.
2019-10-25 16:22:53	iFire	ideal*
2019-10-25 16:23:09	reduz	iFire: you will most likely still need to enable HDR manually if you want to use it
2019-10-25 16:23:27	reduz	because this will force 2D rendering to be HDR too
2019-10-25 16:23:27	iFire	reduz: I saw that referred in the krita blog post

2019-10-25 16:34:22	reduz	iFire: I would first get something working before asking them
2019-10-25 16:34:47	iFire	reduz: so get it working on pure amd hardware first

2019-10-28 12:24:28	dreamsComeTrue[m	Hi, is that a known issue with current alpha, or is it just in my case: either I compiled Godot from current master, or download alpha1/2/3 - they all contain the same error: can't expand resource in Inspector when editing. It concerns all types of resources, not only Materials like on GIF. In 3.1 everything works fine, I am using newest Fedora

2019-10-28 14:49:02	Calinou	on 3.1 stable, it doesn't do this with VBoxContainer but it does with TextureRect
2019-10-28 14:49:27	Calinou	yes, in general, the issue is caused by the node behavior running something in _process() or _fixed_process(), which may force a redraw depending on what it requested
2019-10-28 14:49:41	Calinou	unnecessary redraws can also happen because a property setter doesn't avoid updating if the underlying value didn't change

2019-10-29 11:27:11	Akien	"whatever, it's your project and it seems bug issues are for engine developers, not for engine users..."
2019-10-29 11:27:28	Akien	Well... yes? Maybe we need to make this clearer?
2019-10-29 11:30:31	lawnjelly	He's just trolling imo, you will get always get some with attitude problems / bad day
2019-10-29 11:34:59	Akien	Well I guess he really doesn't understand how both descriptions related to the exact same bug, even though I tried my best to explain it.
2019-10-29 11:36:06	odino	Would be cool if the version 4.0 in Godot would perform its processing dispatching on an ECS pipeline, and so improve the performances and allow large number of movable objects while providing OO support  through the current scene system...
2019-10-29 11:39:41	lawnjelly	There's scope for optimizing some stuff in the scene graph into more DOD structures, maybe cached from the scene graph, yes
2019-10-29 11:43:42	StraToN	Akien Just a vocabulary precision, please pardon my ignorance: what is an "entitled user"?
2019-10-29 11:44:08	odino	From a lot of time this is something that dance into my head, it would require rewrite the current dispatching system.. And for this reason a major release version (like the 4.0) is required. Also is necessary to create a graph composer that is able to read the game scene tree an convert it in a multi thread dispatchable pipeline
2019-10-29 11:44:56	lawnjelly	sounds like something for godot-proposals

2019-10-29 12:05:59	odino	:D expected answer
2019-10-29 12:07:25	reduz	ECS is a one size fits all optimization that works ok for relatively simple things. It's super cool in theory, but for more complex things you need more handcrafted optimizations and algorithms than just putting everything in a linear buffer for better cache coherency
2019-10-29 12:08:02	reduz	reality > theory
2019-10-29 12:09:56	reduz	to add to this, most games requiere few complex objects, and not several simple objects, and in many cases even ECS may fall short in performance and you will need a custom memory layout or use of compute, so optimizations for large amount of dynamic objects are usually yet again something more of a handcrafted thing
2019-10-29 12:11:15	lawnjelly	but it's high fashion
2019-10-29 12:12:25	reduz	well, remember when MVC was high fashion, and everyone was using it for everything
2019-10-29 12:12:27	lawnjelly	I mostly agree though
2019-10-29 12:12:44	lawnjelly	yeah it's a bit of current fad
2019-10-29 12:12:56	lawnjelly	is cool when you have 10,000 archers
2019-10-29 12:13:05	lawnjelly	but a pain in the behind when you've got 20
2019-10-29 12:15:04	reduz	The problem when you are young is that you try to design software by adapting reality to theory, then life beats you up a few times and you understand that reality is too complex for human beings to understand, so you chase after use cases instead of trying to be one step ahead. But still, as no one could convince me otherwise when I was young, I don't expect to convince anyone by writing this either.
2019-10-29 12:16:08	odino	We need numbers in hand to compare the two approaches performances. However what I like about the ECS stuff is how it's possible to expand the engine capabilities without touching even a piece of engine code. Imagine the Flex integration that I did, I was forced to alter the engine while with an ECS like dispatcher this would never happens. Look how much games out here need custom part of the engine and are forced to
2019-10-29 12:16:09	odino	fork it.. Also let me mention that if Unity is changing its dispatching system to ECS putting money there is a reason, I don't think they like to give free money to the developers
2019-10-29 12:17:12	odino	On the other hand the yang people innovate ...
2019-10-29 12:17:14	reduz	Unity needs this mostly because their main programming language is C#, which by design makes it difficult to achieve cache coherency, they are even redesigning the compiler to get this to work better
2019-10-29 12:17:26	odino	young*
2019-10-29 12:20:38	reduz	odino: in any case, I don't expect to convince you of anything, because when I was your age, no one would convince me of these things either. I did put all my ideas to test and shipped a lot of games since I was 18, and I failed again and again until I started to understand you just can't get ahead of things in software.
2019-10-29 12:21:32	reduz	Then I became a consultant, and saw plenty of younger people in companies I worked for fail for trying to do the same
2019-10-29 12:22:36	reduz	So my way of thinking now is: wait for the problem problem, fix the problem, never try get ahead of the problem.
2019-10-29 12:23:38	reduz	and that so far worked great
2019-10-29 12:23:47	reduz	things take longer, but the solutions you arrive to are better
2019-10-29 12:24:00	odino	Is the Unity CTO a young person, that is going to ruin the engine? But what about Overwatch? is Blizzard so crazy to develop an so complicate game using an ECS architecture?
2019-10-29 12:24:45	reduz	Overwatch is a single game, and I already explained you that for Unity it makes sense due to their main programming language being C#
2019-10-29 12:25:34	reduz	you just can't put solutions ahead of problems
2019-10-29 12:25:53	lawnjelly	also ECS is great when you know your access patterns
2019-10-29 12:26:08	lawnjelly	but with general purpose engine used by newbies
2019-10-29 12:26:15	lawnjelly	it can be all over the shop
2019-10-29 12:26:38	lawnjelly	and we can always tweak the important bottleneck stuff
2019-10-29 12:26:44	lawnjelly	to be more linear
2019-10-29 12:26:53	lawnjelly	in memory ...
2019-10-29 12:26:56	odino	Well the problems exist, Godot it's difficult to extend for large projects.. If you don't see this, is a problem ...
2019-10-29 12:27:03	lawnjelly	for example the difference between the scene graph and the visual server
2019-10-29 12:27:20	reduz	odino: that is not a problem to me, I mean, there is not enough granularity in that definirion
2019-10-29 12:28:11	reduz	odino:  a problem is something along the lines of "doing this xxx type of game, or this specific type of thing is difficult"

2019-10-29 12:31:26	odino	lawnjelly, the kind of projects where a general purpose GE is no more enough

2019-10-29 12:32:27	lawnjelly	well isn't godot intended to be general purpose?
2019-10-29 12:32:38	reduz	odino: i dont think there is a kind of problem of that, only specific, individual issues
2019-10-29 12:33:00	reduz	odino: the biggest complaint right now for making more complex things is not having access to the lower level rendering API, compute, and override custom parts of the rendering
2019-10-29 12:33:05	reduz	odino: and this is unrelated to ECS
2019-10-29 12:33:13	lawnjelly	I've written ECS and normal .. ECS is cool and all but it's not a panacea
2019-10-29 12:33:58	reduz	also for complex types of games with huge numbers of elements, compute is so good that it makes less and less sense to make these things on CPU

2019-10-29 12:37:20	reduz	you could probably even do the entire agent logic in compute nowadays
2019-10-29 12:37:55	reduz	if you really need such huge amount of objects being processed
2019-10-29 12:39:11	Technipion	sorry that I suck, but could someone tell me (or give a link) what ECS pipelines are?
2019-10-29 12:39:47	odino	Imagine to integrate an open world with Godot, you have to implement levels streaming. Is likely you have to do it in CPP. Are you able to do it without touching a single line of Godot code? no.. Imagine if this would be possible and you could keep updating your game over the Godot versions without 1 conflict.. (This is just an example)

2019-10-29 12:42:59	lawnjelly	You don't need ECS for open world
2019-10-29 12:43:08	reduz	odino: asset streaming is being worked on, so this should hopefully not be a problem eventually
2019-10-29 12:43:08	lawnjelly	Just paging in and out characters etc
2019-10-29 12:43:38	Technipion	odino: It's entirely possible to asynchronously load ressources in gdscript.
2019-10-29 12:43:50	reduz	odino: it's not there yet simply because there are other priorities, but at most for 4.1 I hope it will be implemented
2019-10-29 12:44:21	odino	The point is that with ECS you don't need to create such things
2019-10-29 12:44:37	reduz	yes, you do
2019-10-29 12:44:45	odino	Because who need it can integrate it without forking godot
2019-10-29 12:45:13	reduz	asset streaming needs a huge amount of custom code in the renderer, and the renderer is not even close to being ECS
2019-10-29 12:45:25	reduz	if it was ECS it would crawl to a snail pace
2019-10-29 12:45:47	Technipion	odino: Why is it so bad to fork Godot if you want to implement something specifically for your game?
2019-10-29 12:46:20	reduz	odino: you need, for example, to keep track of how much memory is being used by everything, and this is very low level code in the renderer resourece management, its not the kind of things you can extend with ECS

2019-10-29 12:54:51	reduz	odino: Again, when you are a young programmer, you usually tend to become a believer of one size fits all solutions that solve many problems at once, even if you don't have first hand experience with those problems. Because your lack of experience makes you  understimate those problems, they appear of lower complexity than they really are so it's easy to fit them all in your head and bias you towards the wrong solution. What ends up
2019-10-29 12:54:52	reduz	hapenning is that you create a system that is far from what you actually need, and steering it towards fixing the real problems you find later on is a massive effort.
2019-10-29 12:55:24	odino	Technipion, because just after 1 month of developing your own fork is likely that you will diverge to Godot and at that point will not be easy anymore to rebase your work with new added feature / fixes...
2019-10-29 12:57:18	Technipion	odino: I get why you would like to see ECS implemented in Godot. But keep in mind a significant part of the community just wants to write "small" 2D games (often for mobile). Is it worth making things more complicated for them just to use ECS?
2019-10-29 12:58:00	odino	reduz, Hmm I could be a young developer... But the point that I'm not able to understand is that: If we follow does the same things over and over just because it works how can we innovate? How can we pass from horses to cars following your reasoning?
2019-10-29 12:58:37	Technipion	You solve a problem in a creative way = Innovation
2019-10-29 12:58:44	odino	I take that I may have low experience, but I wander where will land this way of thinking?
2019-10-29 12:59:07	odino	But if you refuse to be creative because you are too young, how can you innovate?
2019-10-29 12:59:37	Technipion	odino: reduz does not say ECS is bullshit. He just wants you to understand that there is more to an engine than the currently-edge-technology in CG
2019-10-29 12:59:50	reduz	odino: to innovate, you first need to understand a problem
2019-10-29 13:01:25	Technipion	odino: If you come back with a real in-development game that *needs* ECS we can give it a look
2019-10-29 13:02:05	reduz	odino: and to understand a problem, you need to have tried to solve it
2019-10-29 13:02:29	odino	How can you know what I tried and what not?
2019-10-29 13:03:39	reduz	odino: because of the very definition of what a problem is, which in our case, is to make and ship a game
2019-10-29 13:04:08	odino	How can you know that I didn't it?
2019-10-29 13:05:03	reduz	i don't know whether you did or not, but I do know that the problem you are bringing to the table right now is not related to making a game, it is instead a generalization
2019-10-29 13:05:40	Technipion	the question is: odino, can you give us a real existing reason that justifies the hard work and time going into an ECS-integration?
2019-10-29 13:05:42	reduz	odino: try to open a proposal in godot proposals, and you will realize what I mean when you fill the template
2019-10-29 13:06:47	lawnjelly	Aside from the entity component relationships, ECS is most useful when you have to process large numbers of objects simultaneously, which is a very specific game type
2019-10-29 13:07:15	reduz	lawnjelly: yes, and in many of those cases, ECS is still too high level
2019-10-29 13:07:32	reduz	so the domain for the problem it solves is very limited
2019-10-29 13:07:33	lawnjelly	exactly, hence the GPU suggestion etc
2019-10-29 13:07:51	lawnjelly	agree
2019-10-29 13:10:35	odino	You keep watching a small portion of all the good points that an ECS architecture have, and refusing them all together is not the best way to improve things
2019-10-29 13:11:43	reduz	odino: You keep trying to discuss a solution without understanding the problem
2019-10-29 13:11:54	Technipion	odino: But you keep ignoring the huge pluses of the current design. Scene organization with nodes is very intuitive and fast. And very flexible. Why would we abandon that?
2019-10-29 13:14:01	reduz	Communism looked so good when I was young, it had so many good points and solved everything, and capitalism was this horrible thing that enslaved people into working. Then you grow up and realize the social and economic problem is a lot more complex, with so many variables that were not obvious at first.
2019-10-29 13:15:16	Technipion	wow that's a good comparison. Because communism *is* a perfect solution, but can never be achieved in practice. So it looks good on paper, but reality speaks for itself. Just like with ECS ;)
2019-10-29 13:15:59	reduz	Then you realize that social and economic problems in the world are not something where you can just innovate, and most governments try to solve problems depending on their specific needs and culture instead of applying canned solutions, and some do well and some do not.
2019-10-29 13:16:43	reduz	I mean, things are just more complex than what you can envision, so the best you can do is sit, listen to users problems, and try to find solutions based on their specific problems... instead of forcing them to do things in a way where you believe its better
2019-10-29 13:18:12	reduz	odino: so my argument is, human beings are really bad at understanding problems in advance, you only understand them after you solve them
2019-10-29 13:18:24	Vortai[m]	Well I mean communism isn't perfect, it has fundamental flaws in it's assumptions such as assuming evil is only a product of social structure but that's neither here nor there.
2019-10-29 13:20:18	Technipion	since I've studied physics I can tell you that you can solve a problem without fully understanding it. Definetely without understanding it...
2019-10-29 13:20:27	Akien	Interesting how a discussion about ECS ends up on discussing communism vs capitalism :P
2019-10-29 13:20:29	Vortai[m]	reduz: not to highjack things but how different is godots underlying server system from an ECS system?
2019-10-29 13:20:44	reduz	Akien: wait for hitler
2019-10-29 13:21:08	Akien	IMO the important thing for any ECS buzzword discussion is to properly define: 1) What do I mean by ECS exactly? 2) How does it articulate with the existing architecture? 3) What benefits would I get from it?
2019-10-29 13:21:24	Akien	And most importantly 0) What is my concrete use case to try to get the benefits in (3)?
2019-10-29 13:22:43	reduz	Akien: yes it is as you say, it needs to be discussed as a problem that needs to be solved, not as a solution
2019-10-29 13:22:45	Technipion	I thought we were talking about an entity component system where a bunch of entities (basically ints) are continuously updated by systems (physics, graphics, etc) highly in parallel
2019-10-29 13:23:06	reduz	the problem is that, in servers, you dont process all objects all the time
2019-10-29 13:24:08	reduz	for physics, you process pairs of objects that change frame by frame, and you process them based on the islands the form, so you can scale to multiple threads
2019-10-29 13:24:47	Vortai[m]	And in ECS you do? I thought the systems would dictate when any why they process relevent components?
2019-10-29 13:25:21	reduz	in ECS you put all the same components of the same type in a linear buffer
2019-10-29 13:25:48	reduz	that need to be processed together, it makes the most sense for systems where the components that need to be processed dont vary that much from frame to frame
2019-10-29 13:26:35	reduz	in rendering, you process what is visible to the camera (frustum) or to lights (shadow mapping), which can change wildly if camera rotates or light moves
2019-10-29 13:28:02	reduz	in these cases, you are more memory bound, but its still more efficient because you process less elements, so the amount of memory you touch is less
2019-10-29 13:28:23	reduz	its like a binary search vs a linear search. Binary search is very memory inefficient, but it scales better than linear search
2019-10-29 13:28:57	reduz	for few elements, linear search is faster, for many binary is faster.

2019-10-29 17:15:46	RevoluPowered	https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/yKwM3c4s/image.png
2019-10-29 17:16:16	RevoluPowered	uploaded a slightly simpler model
2019-10-29 17:16:19	RevoluPowered	demo
2019-10-29 17:18:43	reduz	yes indeed
2019-10-29 17:18:47	reduz	but you can collapse them easily i think
2019-10-29 17:18:53	RevoluPowered	Yeah I think so
2019-10-29 17:18:53	reduz	even for animation
2019-10-29 17:19:14	RevoluPowered	I think the formula from the fbx sdk can actually be used on the animated node to just 'compile them out'
2019-10-29 17:19:43	RevoluPowered	I think that is what really needs to be in assimp
2019-10-29 17:19:58	reduz	yes, every frame you sample, you regen the transform, then you obtain loc/rot/scale
2019-10-29 17:20:12	RevoluPowered	so I could do that before giving godot the animation
2019-10-29 17:20:19	RevoluPowered	just to keep it simple
2019-10-29 17:20:49	RevoluPowered	oh. Or use a post process to compile them out and be lazy :D
2019-10-29 17:21:12	RevoluPowered	I might need a few custom types but I can make that work in a post process in assimp

2019-10-29 17:27:10	RevoluPowered	The post process might  be the best option
2019-10-29 17:27:23	RevoluPowered	It would mean that the GLTF importer would also get the ability to handle them
2019-10-29 17:27:33	RevoluPowered	or other formats

2019-10-29 17:38:31	reduz	i dont think GLTF or any other format has pivots
2019-10-29 17:39:07	reduz	this is only exclusively a FBX thing, because mostly MAX has pivots (not sure if Maya does too)
2019-10-29 17:44:27	RevoluPowered	maya does
2019-10-29 17:44:42	RevoluPowered	all autodesk products have pivots :(
2019-10-29 17:45:02	RevoluPowered	nd they are all different too
2019-10-29 17:45:35	RevoluPowered	I should be more specific
2019-10-29 17:45:43	RevoluPowered	All 3D autodesk products :L
2019-10-29 17:46:02	RevoluPowered	We didn't care about max but maya support was kinda hard because of the pivot data
2019-10-29 17:46:36	RevoluPowered	```WorldTransform = ParentWorldTransform * T * Roff * Rp * Rpre * R * Rpost -1 * Rp -1 * Soff * Sp * S * Sp -1 ``` This code is for maya and the FBX SDK users who export from FBX SDK
2019-10-29 17:46:50	RevoluPowered	```WorldTransform = ParentWorldTransform * T * R * S * OT * OR * OS``` whereas this is for max
2019-10-29 17:47:13	RevoluPowered	they are quite similar
2019-10-29 17:52:29	iFire	I'm feeling better. Then, I took a flu vaccine, so I'm feeling week again.
2019-10-29 17:52:33	iFire	weak*

2019-10-30 13:47:10	lawnjelly	Actually now I look at Vector3 there's quite a few things that could be better
2019-10-30 13:47:34	lawnjelly	Was looking at #33177 earlier
2019-10-30 13:47:35	IssueBot	#33177: Added some functions to harmonize Vector2/Vector3 | https://git.io/Jezkq
2019-10-30 13:47:52	lawnjelly	normalize() could return the length, as it is calculated there, rather than void
2019-10-30 13:48:00	lawnjelly	it's often useful to return length
2019-10-30 13:48:13	lawnjelly	and it will be optimized out when not used
2019-10-30 13:48:32	lawnjelly	there's a lot of division by dividing the individual elements .. e.g.
2019-10-30 13:49:09	lawnjelly	x /= A, y /= A, z /= A
2019-10-30 13:49:35	lawnjelly	where it can be B = 1.0f / A, x *= B, y *= B, z *= B
2019-10-30 13:50:41	lawnjelly	unless the SIMD divide is the same speed, i might check that later
2019-10-30 13:56:26	Calinou	yeah, check both debug and release builds' performance (with LTO)
2019-10-30 13:57:02	lawnjelly	am just trying the division in a testbed

2019-10-30 14:03:52	lawnjelly	scratch that
2019-10-30 14:04:18	RevoluPowered	morning
2019-10-30 14:10:32	lawnjelly	tested and the divide was quicker
2019-10-30 14:11:04	lawnjelly	maybe as it can do it all as one SIMD op
2019-10-30 14:21:21	Calinou	oh, just noticed the new article, https://godotengine.org/article/dtls-report-1
2019-10-30 14:21:31	Calinou	will submit it to Reddit :P
2019-10-30 14:46:10	lawnjelly	actually bug in my profiling, the divide and multiply method come out exactly the same, so might as well keep the current method
2019-10-30 14:46:36	lawnjelly	SIMD multiply is marginally faster than the divide, but you have to do an extra divide before the operation so it evens out
2019-10-30 14:50:10	lawnjelly	and divide is much faster if you allow inlining and unrolling over multiple calls to the functions

2019-10-31 12:14:41	lawnjelly	hi puthre!!
2019-10-31 12:14:48	lawnjelly	sorry was examining the code
2019-10-31 12:15:01	lawnjelly	I have no idea what's going on... with the inlining haha
2019-10-31 12:15:18	lawnjelly	can you see anything obvious?
2019-10-31 12:15:49	lawnjelly	with your test code it's faster on my system too, but that is with inlining
2019-10-31 12:16:06	puthre	I don't yet understand what are you looking for
2019-10-31 12:16:38	lawnjelly	well the non-inlined code is going faster than the inlined
2019-10-31 12:17:35	puthre	you see that on your code or mine?
2019-10-31 12:17:38	lawnjelly	on yours as well
2019-10-31 12:17:43	lawnjelly	well for case (a)
2019-10-31 12:17:58	lawnjelly	case (b) i think on yours is marginally faster with inlining
2019-10-31 12:18:58	lawnjelly	it's just very odd, you'd expect inlining would always be faster or at the worst, the same
2019-10-31 12:19:12	puthre	are you sure the compiler cares about your noiline directive?
2019-10-31 12:19:43	lawnjelly	well it must be doing something as the timings are different depending whether it is defined or not
2019-10-31 12:20:07	lawnjelly	but whether it is doing as intended .. maybe not
2019-10-31 12:20:10	puthre	you can try kcachegrind
2019-10-31 12:20:29	lawnjelly	yeah i'll try that to compare
2019-10-31 12:20:41	puthre	i think it shows you this kind of things
2019-10-31 12:21:12	lawnjelly	i usually use callgrind for inside e.g. godot
2019-10-31 12:21:25	lawnjelly	but for a testbed you should just be able to compare the timings
2019-10-31 12:21:49	puthre	yes, but it will show you exactly where the difference comes from
2019-10-31 12:21:56	puthre	it may me something unexpected
2019-10-31 12:22:03	lawnjelly	k i'll have a look i'll get a coffee hehe
2019-10-31 12:22:11	lawnjelly	i find these things interesting though
2019-10-31 12:23:51	puthre	or maybe the inlining messes up something that it can do in parallel otherwise but I can't imagine what
2019-10-31 12:25:31	lawnjelly	ahh just had a brainwave it could be the bit of code to prevent the compiler optimizing the test out
2019-10-31 12:25:46	lawnjelly	i'll change it to add up the output values instead of if statement
2019-10-31 12:32:04	lawnjelly	yeah it's something in the compiler optimizing out

2019-10-31 12:33:06	lawnjelly	(a) is now faster in both cases now and it behaves as expected
2019-10-31 12:33:20	lawnjelly	let me look at yours and check the compiler is not optimizing out the test

2019-10-31 15:52:33	RevoluPowered	morning
2019-10-31 16:02:51	RevoluPowered	@iFire so for pivot transforms they have 'geometric xforms' which are only applied to the node
2019-10-31 16:03:21	RevoluPowered	I am having to add 'geometric xform' data to assimp so that the geometric xform can be inversed in the engine
2019-10-31 16:03:45	RevoluPowered	which is kinda annoying
2019-10-31 16:04:04	RevoluPowered	but can't think of a way of inversing the geometric xform from all of the children aiNodes without storing it somewhere
2019-10-31 16:04:54	RevoluPowered	unless godot has post, and pre xforms somewhere?
2019-10-31 16:05:37	RevoluPowered	@reduz do you know of a way of applying an xform to a node but not applying to the children like a 'post' matrix
2019-10-31 16:06:08	RevoluPowered	I don't want to iterate the children to inverse in godot
2019-10-31 16:06:11	RevoluPowered	I can do it in assimp
2019-10-31 16:06:25	RevoluPowered	but if godot can do it I don't need to do it in assimp
2019-10-31 16:06:37	lawnjelly	ah was just going to suggest that
2019-10-31 16:06:48	lawnjelly	apply the inverse to the children
2019-10-31 16:06:51	RevoluPowered	yeah
2019-10-31 16:07:04	RevoluPowered	I am having to also create pivot keyframes
2019-10-31 16:07:22	RevoluPowered	but I can fold them down into trans, rot, scale
2019-10-31 16:07:30	RevoluPowered	so that godot doesn't know
2019-10-31 16:07:33	RevoluPowered	but then the same issue applies
2019-10-31 16:07:41	RevoluPowered	I need geometric inverse keyframes from children
2019-10-31 16:07:55	reduz	RevoluPowered: you mean to apply the pivots? but i dont understand why you would need to do that
2019-10-31 16:08:31	RevoluPowered	yeah so basically to make 'geometric pivots' appear correct in godot they want a pivot point which doesn't effect the children nodes
2019-10-31 16:08:45	RevoluPowered	https://help.autodesk.com/view/FBX/2017/ENU/?guid=__files_GUID_10CDD63C_79C1_4F2D_BB28_AD2BE65A02ED_htm
2019-10-31 16:08:52	RevoluPowered	OT OR OS on that page is why
2019-10-31 16:09:05	reduz	RevoluPowered: i am not sure you should care about that, all you should do is multiply the transform I think
2019-10-31 16:09:12	RevoluPowered	"Geometric transformations are not inherited: ParentWorldTransform does not contain the OT, OR, and OS of WorldTransform’s parent node. "
2019-10-31 16:09:21	RevoluPowered	I have to unfortunately
2019-10-31 16:09:23	reduz	oh
2019-10-31 16:09:24	RevoluPowered	I have tested without
2019-10-31 16:09:27	RevoluPowered	and it doesn't work
2019-10-31 16:09:30	reduz	that sucks
2019-10-31 16:09:56	RevoluPowered	Yeah
2019-10-31 16:10:04	RevoluPowered	I might just do the inverse children thing in assimp
2019-10-31 16:10:12	RevoluPowered	and try and transparently supply to godot
2019-10-31 16:10:22	RevoluPowered	Blender doesn't support this either
2019-10-31 16:10:32	RevoluPowered	It can't import FBX files with this
2019-10-31 16:10:56	RevoluPowered	so we are about to pass blender in terms of fbx support
2019-10-31 16:11:06	RevoluPowered	https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/luminaris-starship-b8001c7cf83240f383ccdbe75094e468
2019-10-31 16:11:13	RevoluPowered	example
2019-10-31 16:11:16	RevoluPowered	breaks in blender
2019-10-31 16:11:18	RevoluPowered	works in fbx sdk
2019-10-31 16:11:25	RevoluPowered	engine components are pivot keyframes
2019-10-31 16:11:37	RevoluPowered	such a stupid animation to even use pivots imo
2019-10-31 16:11:51	RevoluPowered	but 3ds max decided 'oh this is a good idea to use a pivot'
2019-10-31 16:12:07	RevoluPowered	In my opinion no reason to use pivots there, just use a rotation keyframe...
2019-10-31 16:12:11	RevoluPowered	#autodesk fial
2019-10-31 16:12:13	RevoluPowered	fail*
2019-10-31 16:13:04	reduz	pivots and skins are terrible ideas imo
2019-10-31 16:13:15	RevoluPowered	yeah
2019-10-31 16:13:16	reduz	but nothing we can do about it
2019-10-31 16:13:25	RevoluPowered	except set it on fire and run away?
2019-10-31 16:13:50	RevoluPowered	these actually bloat the files too and slow down loading for no good reason
2019-10-31 16:14:14	RevoluPowered	because you're doing 9 matrix multiplications sometimes 12, per node during import
2019-10-31 16:14:16	RevoluPowered	for no reason
2019-10-31 16:14:49	RevoluPowered	https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/qfFIJVMy/image.png
2019-10-31 16:15:15	RevoluPowered	I now have to store OT OR OS somewhere in assimp to inverse later on
2019-10-31 16:15:22	RevoluPowered	or add the pivots to the aiNode
2019-10-31 16:15:28	RevoluPowered	which kim might not like
2019-10-31 16:16:28	reduz	... wow
2019-10-31 16:16:50	RevoluPowered	yes
2019-10-31 16:16:52	reduz	the alternative is to do transform baking in assimp and support transform based keyframes, like collada does
2019-10-31 16:16:59	reduz	but still sucks
2019-10-31 16:17:05	RevoluPowered	that would be actually the best way

2019-10-31 16:17:32	odino	o/
2019-10-31 16:17:40	RevoluPowered	I am already trying to bake them into the trans, rot and scale keys
2019-10-31 16:17:47	RevoluPowered	I might be able to do it in a simpler manner
2019-10-31 16:18:08	reduz	RevoluPowered: well, you can kind of bake them in locrotscale, but i think that maaay break some animations, not quite sure
2019-10-31 16:18:18	reduz	well, i guess it should not
2019-10-31 16:18:20	reduz	hi odino!
2019-10-31 16:18:31	RevoluPowered	I was thinking, instead of fbx using keyframes just having 'matrix' frames if it's a simpler case non maya it will still work, then I can fold pivots into them
2019-10-31 16:18:50	reduz	RevoluPowered: feel free to ask Kim about this, Collada supports them already
2019-10-31 16:18:55	RevoluPowered	ah cool
2019-10-31 16:19:00	RevoluPowered	@kim
2019-10-31 16:19:03	RevoluPowered	ah he's away
2019-10-31 16:19:11	reduz	is he around?
2019-10-31 16:19:19	RevoluPowered	he came in yesterday
2019-10-31 16:19:48	RevoluPowered	let me check collada in assimp
2019-10-31 16:20:03	RevoluPowered	never knew it supported OT OR OS
2019-10-31 16:21:50	reduz	iFire: oh hey this one seems to have proper pbr and is downloadable
2019-10-31 16:21:53	reduz	iFire: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/sponza-scene-725bc7dc88b049a5b38bfa718b218909
2019-10-31 16:22:49	RevoluPowered	yeah it only supports locrotscale in collada in assimp
2019-10-31 16:23:17	RevoluPowered	it's okay we know that inverse the children will work
2019-10-31 16:23:33	reduz	RevoluPowered: matrix is not supported in assimp? :\
2019-10-31 16:23:35	RevoluPowered	it's still faster than the previous way they were doing it
2019-10-31 16:23:43	RevoluPowered	matrix is
2019-10-31 16:23:50	RevoluPowered	but it uses loc rot scale keyframes
2019-10-31 16:23:58	RevoluPowered	so it decomposes them out
2019-10-31 16:24:03	reduz	oh
2019-10-31 16:24:14	reduz	well, you can convert to locrotscale for sampling i guess
2019-10-31 16:24:17	RevoluPowered	yeah
2019-10-31 16:24:27	reduz	matrix -> locrotscale
2019-10-31 16:24:30	RevoluPowered	yeah
2019-10-31 16:24:31	reduz	and use the same way it does for collada
2019-10-31 16:24:34	reduz	not the best, but it should do
2019-10-31 16:24:49	reduz	non uniform scaling will most likely break, but too bad
2019-10-31 16:24:53	reduz	dont use pivots for it
2019-10-31 16:25:06	RevoluPowered	oh I didn't know that would break
2019-10-31 16:25:10	RevoluPowered	why does that break?
2019-10-31 16:25:13	reduz	well, it will break in godot later on anyway
2019-10-31 16:25:32	RevoluPowered	ah okay
2019-10-31 16:25:58	reduz	try scaling a node in a coordinate only and then rotate a child, you will see a non uniform rotation
2019-10-31 16:26:09	reduz	so sampled stuff generally fixes this
2019-10-31 16:26:52	RevoluPowered	ah
2019-10-31 16:27:27	lawnjelly	are the pivots extra useless nodes in between the bones that you want to get rid of?
2019-10-31 16:33:06	Akien	reduz: See https://github.com/GodotVR/godot_oculus_mobile/issues/60, it looks like we have a precision issue with TIME in GLES2
2019-10-31 16:33:36	Akien	Can we make TIME be defined with mediump too, or should it be handled differently?
2019-10-31 16:33:51	Akien	(see detailed comment by NeoSpark314 who debugged the issue)
2019-10-31 16:34:24	lawnjelly	there's another issue on this I wrote on it let me find it

2019-10-31 16:35:35	Akien	reduz: in this commit you made on HTML5 use highp: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/b32298a660f95abd94b7dc9e7ea68bd38150d149
2019-10-31 16:36:01	RevoluPowered	@lawnjelly no they're not extra nodes anymore, but they are extra computation to read in an fbx file
2019-10-31 16:36:03	reduz	the problem is that on older devices, highp computation is _extremely_ expensive
2019-10-31 16:36:15	lawnjelly	some don't do highp at all
2019-10-31 16:36:23	RevoluPowered	but in terms of 3DS max they are an extra matrix which we don't want
2019-10-31 16:36:24	lawnjelly	they only do it if you don't touch the UV in the shader
2019-10-31 16:36:25	reduz	Akien: but we can harcode the time variable to be highp, i dont see the problem
2019-10-31 16:37:06	Akien	reduz: it is highp already, which seems to cause the issue.
2019-10-31 16:37:18	Akien	See https://github.com/GodotVR/godot_oculus_mobile/issues/60#issuecomment-548254360
2019-10-31 16:38:08	lawnjelly	they have a codepath for highp which only works if you don't touch the UV, but it's on older hardware, maybe it's on this device too
2019-10-31 16:38:36	reduz	Akien: maybe for visual shader we should propagete the highp inputs somehow?
2019-10-31 16:38:51	reduz	Akien: I cant think of an easy solution for this
2019-10-31 16:39:09	reduz	Akien: oh i think you can configure the rollaround time for TIME in quality settings

2019-10-31 16:45:57	Akien	reduz: Which setting is that?
2019-10-31 16:46:51	lawnjelly	If you move the code that depends on TIME to the vertex shader and use it to modify UVs then you will see if it is the codepath 'feature'
2019-10-31 16:47:10	lawnjelly	if you lose the point filtering by not touching the UVs in the fragment shader .. that's it
2019-10-31 16:47:22	lawnjelly	it is more efficient because the fragment shader can read ahead of time the value
2019-10-31 16:47:33	lawnjelly	if you touch the UVs in the fragment shader it can't read ahead the texture
2019-10-31 16:48:01	lawnjelly	is kind of like 'discard' in that way
2019-10-31 16:52:18	Akien	lawnjelly: That seems right, I moved the TIME usage to `vertex` and now it works ok.
2019-10-31 16:52:29	lawnjelly	You see, I am skill lol
2019-10-31 16:52:35	Akien	https://hastebin.com/oyecucovok.cpp
2019-10-31 16:53:12	lawnjelly	my TV android box got me onto it...
2019-10-31 16:53:25	lawnjelly	I had horrible point filtering with fragment shaders
2019-10-31 16:53:35	lawnjelly	this is long before godot
2019-10-31 16:54:06	lawnjelly	and i found an obscure article which mentioned it, by a hardware guy
2019-10-31 16:54:18	lawnjelly	dunno if i still have the link i'll look in my bookmarks
2019-10-31 16:55:59	Akien	lawnjelly: So the question is if we should just document this as an Android/GLES2 quirk, or if we can address this at engine level. Apparently forcing the high precision path seems to solve it as per https://github.com/GodotVR/godot_oculus_mobile/issues/60#issuecomment-548254360
2019-10-31 16:57:01	Akien	And in both issues the problem arised when using TIME in Visual Shader - maybe VS should properly do the TIME use in vertex and use the output in fragment?
2019-10-31 16:57:14	reduz	forcing high precision kills performance in actual GLES2 phones
2019-10-31 16:57:31	lawnjelly	ah that i didn't expect .. the forcing high precision worked at all .. that hardware must behave different
2019-10-31 16:58:41	Akien	Yeah, this was tested on an Oculus Quest which is likely not a low end phone :D
2019-10-31 16:58:50	lawnjelly	I concur that forcing high precision is not desirable on all devices
2019-10-31 16:59:17	reduz	Akien: maybe we should make forcing high percision on gles2 optional
2019-10-31 16:59:33	reduz	on modern phones it likely wont make much of a difference
2019-10-31 16:59:37	lawnjelly	yeah I was going to suggest that .. it's all you can do really i think
2019-10-31 16:59:52	lawnjelly	if someone wants to use a funky GLES2 fragment shader they can
2019-10-31 17:00:14	lawnjelly	but shouldn't deteriorate performance for most people who won't need it
2019-10-31 17:00:45	Akien	reduz: Sounds good.
2019-10-31 17:01:23	lawnjelly	ideally you'd be able to swap shader in the game
2019-10-31 17:01:41	lawnjelly	according to if it misbehaves ..
2019-10-31 17:01:58	lawnjelly	you can detect the precision at high / med / lo
2019-10-31 17:02:08	lawnjelly	but you can't detect afaik whether it does the codepath trick
2019-10-31 17:17:39	lawnjelly	Found the article! Have posted it on the issue

2019-11-04 13:24:01	reduz	luminance reduction using compute is amazing
2019-11-04 13:25:11	reduz	you can reduce the entire scene image, precisely almost for free. Before, to get enough performance, had to use a smaller starting point image and lose some detail

2019-11-05 10:34:53	lawnjelly	darn it, I've realised there is a problem with doing shadow caster tight culling and the shadow map caching
2019-11-05 10:35:41	lawnjelly	in that if it draws a subset to the shadow map and the view changes, it won't treat the shadow as dirty
2019-11-05 10:36:24	lawnjelly	doing this from my module gets around this problem but doing it in core has to deal with the light-geometry pairing

2019-11-05 10:50:50	lawnjelly	it can be got around in core in 3.2 but it makes it less elegant, and edge cases to deal with
2019-11-05 10:51:41	lawnjelly	whereas reduz said he was going to redo the pairing in 4.0 and this could all be dealt with at the same time
2019-11-05 10:51:58	--	madmiraal1 is now known as madmiraal
2019-11-05 10:52:18	minraws	lawnjelly: yep
2019-11-05 10:52:22	lawnjelly	when i do it in my module I check each light per frame for culling
2019-11-05 10:52:40	lawnjelly	whereas where I'm currently inserting the culling in core, it's only done if the shadow is dirty
2019-11-05 10:52:49	lawnjelly	so I'd need to place the culling check elsewhere in core
2019-11-05 10:52:51	minraws	That seems like that might have a performance penalty.
2019-11-05 10:53:04	lawnjelly	the culling in the module is cheap
2019-11-05 10:53:26	lawnjelly	but possibly less so in core
2019-11-05 10:53:29	lawnjelly	i'll have a think
2019-11-05 10:54:10	lawnjelly	however culling out entire lights from view could still be done quite easily i believe
2019-11-05 10:54:51	lawnjelly	it's kind of a strategy thing, because at the moment the whole light pairing with geometry is an optimization
2019-11-05 10:55:10	lawnjelly	based on the hope that there will be no dynamic geometry in the light view...
2019-11-05 10:55:15	lawnjelly	if there isn't, it's a win
2019-11-05 10:55:22	lawnjelly	if there is, it's a loss
2019-11-05 10:55:35	lawnjelly	in real games you will tend to have animated characters etc
2019-11-05 10:55:47	lawnjelly	it's not the same as e.g. an architectural simulation
2019-11-05 10:56:07	lawnjelly	so the situation of no dynamic geometry in a light view is unlikely
2019-11-05 10:56:27	lawnjelly	which makes the whole pairing thing slightly questionable in fact
2019-11-05 10:56:46	minraws	Yep makes sense.
2019-11-05 10:57:20	lawnjelly	it would be interesting to see how much pairing gives a cached shadow map in a real game
2019-11-05 10:57:48	lawnjelly	there might be other things the pairing is used for though, i'm not sure, would have to ask reduz about this
2019-11-05 10:58:07	minraws	Would really depend on the type of lighting and pace of the game.
2019-11-05 10:58:18	minraws	Actually if you haven't read it you could read Bittner's paper on Shadow Caster Culling as well.
2019-11-05 10:58:32	lawnjelly	oo i'll google it
2019-11-05 10:58:52	lawnjelly	i got a tighter culling for the cones working this morning to cull out spotlights entirely
2019-11-05 10:59:12	lawnjelly	i think in practice one of the biggest wins will be removing entire realtime lights

2019-11-05 10:59:24	lawnjelly	because the PCF for rendering etc is very expensive

2019-11-05 11:16:09	lawnjelly	just culling to the frustum is the first step and very cheap
2019-11-05 11:16:40	lawnjelly	and a match for godot 3 as it does no occlusion culling
2019-11-05 11:17:01	lawnjelly	when you use occlusion culling you can take advantage of that for shadow caster culling, but it depends what system you use
2019-11-05 11:18:49	lawnjelly	at the moment as standard in godot 3, doing more advanced culling within the camera frustum would yield little benefit i think

2019-11-05 12:32:04	lawnjelly	reduz: would I be correct in saying that currently the shadow map caching works by rendering everything from the light point of view?
2019-11-05 12:32:17	Akien	Morning reduz
2019-11-05 12:32:28	lawnjelly	and if neither the light nor the paired objects move, there is no need to make the shadow map dirty?
2019-11-05 12:32:31	Akien	reduz: Just FYI, I have a PR currently building on CI to do formatting fixes and a VS build fix for vulkan
2019-11-05 12:32:45	reduz	lawnjelly: that is right
2019-11-05 12:32:58	Akien	Should be ready to merge in ~5 min.
2019-11-05 12:33:06	lawnjelly	so this is a trade off .. it means that the shadow map may be rendering objects that are not in camera view...
2019-11-05 12:33:31	reduz	lawnjelly: yes, that is expected, but at the same time the rendering of those objects is pretty cheap
2019-11-05 12:33:49	lawnjelly	I was wondering how often the case of a non-dirty light happens in games
2019-11-05 12:34:02	lawnjelly	with dynamic objects moving around
2019-11-05 12:34:09	Akien	Now clang-format is mostly behaving on shader code, but there's one thing it does that I reverted back manually for now: https://hastebin.com/xenavadeqa.diff
2019-11-05 12:34:20	reduz	lawnjelly: pretty often
2019-11-05 12:34:21	Akien	Not sure why it's doing that, but I guess we don't want this kind of formatting.
2019-11-05 12:34:39	RevoluPowered	Morning
2019-11-05 12:34:54	lawnjelly	yeah i found that was a problem anyway for adding culling of shadow casters to the camera frustum
2019-11-05 12:34:58	reduz	lawnjelly: omni and spots in godot only update if something moves in there
2019-11-05 12:35:06	lawnjelly	the caching gets mucked up
2019-11-05 12:35:19	lawnjelly	because if it renders a subset, and the camera view changes
2019-11-05 12:35:34	lawnjelly	the light should really be made dirty again
2019-11-05 12:36:16	lawnjelly	so I think it makes it more difficult to integrate in core at this stage, i'll leave it for now i think

2019-11-06 09:04:40	Einlander	i have currently settled on set_axis_velocity
2019-11-06 09:12:00	odino	apply_force would be better for constant force application, however probably you have some problems with friction application since it slow down your RB
2019-11-06 09:13:08	odino	I don't think that remove friction is a good solution, so apply the velocity each frame is necessary (even if I prefer add a force)
2019-11-06 09:13:39	odino	(BTW a lot depend on what you are trying to simulate)
2019-11-06 09:18:44	Einlander	I am using s rigid body capsule set as character to make an fps controller
2019-11-06 09:19:22	Einlander	I need the controller to interact physically with the environment (walk into things of the proper weight and move them)
2019-11-06 09:22:39	odino	In this case add force each physics frame is what you need, so your character can always fully interact with the environment
2019-11-06 09:23:30	Einlander	wouldn't set_axis_velocity also work?
2019-11-06 09:23:59	odino	(Note: you need to apply different forces, eg: 1 walking force and another opposed to that that slow down the character when nothing is pressed)
2019-11-06 09:24:38	Einlander	i was going to manually modulate the speed
2019-11-06 09:25:03	Einlander	but using apply_impulse every frame makes it incrementally faster

2019-11-06 09:25:50	odino	set velocity is not optimal, let's suppose that the character is pushed on the walking axis; By setting the velocity you remove the external pushing force applied.
2019-11-06 09:26:10	odino	Yep, for this reason you need to apply many forces each frame
2019-11-06 09:26:24	odino	(However use add_force, not apply impulse)
2019-11-06 09:31:01	Einlander	add_force and apply_impulse does nothing for my character :/
2019-11-06 09:31:05	Einlander	justs stands there

2019-11-06 09:32:54	Einlander	set axis seems to work and it respects other rigid body weight
2019-11-06 09:33:41	Einlander	ie: it cant walk through objects heaver than it, and heavy enough objects slow it down

2019-11-06 13:27:11	Technipion	I thought Godot 4.0 will have drop-in renderers? Wouldn't that allow to have an old-style GLES renderer with the newest version?
2019-11-06 13:27:37	Technipion	Because that would not break compatibility...?
2019-11-06 13:29:11	Akien	RevoluPowered: Once we release a new main version, we branch it off from master. So we have 2.1, 3.0 and 3.1 branches where fixes can be cherry-picked to make maintenance releases.
2019-11-06 13:29:46	Akien	For 3.2 that will be the same, as soon as 3.2-stable is tagged I will create the matching `3.2` branch from master, which will be used for 3.2.x releases.
2019-11-06 13:33:44	RevoluPowered	ah cool
2019-11-06 13:33:46	Calinou	lawnjelly: we should look at adding 2-dimensional SDF for font rendering too, it looks better than single SDF for that purpose, especially at smaller sizes
2019-11-06 13:33:51	Calinou	it should be fast enough on desktop at least
2019-11-06 13:33:57	Calinou	https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen
2019-11-06 13:34:07	RevoluPowered	that makes sense actually then you don't accidentally include something which is only in 3.2.x releases and forget it in master
2019-11-06 13:37:43	lawnjelly	Calinou: ah I was thinking more in terms of collision / visibility checking, and rendering uses, but the font thing is cool too :)
2019-11-06 13:38:03	Calinou	DynamicFont is all cool, but you can't scale it at run-time without quality loss
2019-11-06 13:38:17	Calinou	(well, I should say real-time actually, re-rendering it when the window size changes is fine)
2019-11-06 13:38:28	Calinou	distance fields could also be used for SVG -> mesh rendering

2019-11-06 13:40:27	Akien	RevoluPowered: yeah, the policy is that we only do cherry-picks of master commits in the stable branches, so that they don't get features or bug fixes that master wouldn't have.
2019-11-06 13:40:46	Akien	RevoluPowered: though when master and older branches have diverged too much, sometimes old branch-specific PRs are still relevant.
2019-11-06 13:41:49	Akien	And for 4.0/3.2.x parallel development we'll probably need to make most cherry-picks to 3.2.x with a dedicated PR, as chances are that the code won't be fully portable due to mass changes planned (like C++14 use, some code style chances, and API changes)
2019-11-06 13:42:05	Calinou	yeah, I made a specific PR for `3.1` recently because it didn't make sense in `master`

2019-11-06 15:48:26	Akien	reduz: clayjohn: He kept his project on 3.0.6 due to the regression in 3.1, and probably would skip 3.2 too if it still has the regression. So it would be nice to address this for 3.2 as Infinistate is one of the bigger games we have around to showcase Godot.
2019-11-06 15:49:11	Akien	If there's no clear "fix"/better solution, maybe an option to get back the previous logic would be good?

2019-11-06 16:02:49	reduz	Akien: did you ask him if this improve in 4.x ?
2019-11-06 16:03:18	reduz	because I am not quite sure what is going on. I think in 3.0.x it was a bug, but i think once fixed, the problem is that it looks bad because we use DP
2019-11-06 16:03:28	reduz	so my feeling is that it should look fixed in 4.x because we no longer use DP atlases
2019-11-06 16:06:05	Groud	It is kind of weird we have results so different to substance or eevee though
2019-11-06 16:07:29	reduz	It should be the same in 4.x because we use cubemaps, but worse case we can just copy the formula eevee uses, which should be the same I think anyway

2019-11-06 16:25:26	qbieshay	I have a question: I noticed that the InputEventMouseMotion does not expose a `pressed` property, but it is possible to use the `is_pressed` function on it. And the function works
2019-11-06 16:26:40	qbieshay	I'm wondering if this is an inconsistency that should be taken care of or not (expose a `pressed` property on everything that inherits from InputEvent, which is the class that exposes the function `is_pressed`
2019-11-06 16:35:11	reduz	qbieshay: it has a buttom nask

2019-11-06 17:11:17	iFire	clayjohn: is there a physics image we can rendering to?
2019-11-06 17:11:30	Calinou	we don't have to keep rendering 100% accurate for 4.0
2019-11-06 17:11:43	Calinou	as long as APIs can be converted automatically, the renderer can look different
2019-11-06 17:12:06	Calinou	if anything, materials looking *less* shiny would be appreciated by most people in my experience, even if their project intended to use less rough materials at first :)
2019-11-06 17:12:13	iFire	I feel like comparing substance or eevee is the wrong way of doing this. It should be compared with a physically based render like appleseed, or a photo of a scene that is recreated into Godot 4.0
2019-11-06 17:12:18	Calinou	(but I think most people use roughness maps as intended by Substance)
2019-11-06 17:12:24	Calinou	which look too shiny in Godot right now
2019-11-06 17:12:39	clayjohn	Calinou: yes. For 4.0. akien was asking if we could change for 3.2, or add a separate option to revert behaviour.
2019-11-06 17:12:47	Calinou	oh, right
2019-11-06 17:13:00	Calinou	yeah, it needs to be made opt-in for 3.2 somehow
2019-11-06 17:13:53	Calinou	when I tried sqrt()ing the roughness map back in 3.0.x, it felt like an upgrade overall
2019-11-06 17:14:07	Calinou	(so the effective roughness was overall increased, but non-rough surfaces stayed non-rough)
2019-11-06 17:14:48	Calinou	maybe this has to do with gamma correcting roughness maps? I don't know if it has to be done in the first place
2019-11-06 17:18:14	Akien	Yeah IMO if we could add an option in 3.2 that makes the roughness closer to the substance or eevee output, that would be great.
2019-11-06 17:18:40	Akien	3.2 is here to stay for a while as 4.0 will take time and some with big projects in GLES3 won't want to migrate, so this kind of option is important I think.
2019-11-06 17:19:05	Groud	If we know how to solve the problem
2019-11-06 17:19:17	Groud	But yeah, that would be great
2019-11-06 17:19:51	Akien	fracteed seems to say that it's about a 4 lines change to get back something he's fine with (3.0.6 output)
2019-11-06 17:20:35	Groud	Oh ok
2019-11-06 17:21:31	Groud	I'm kind of surprised there is no definitive and common way to render basic PBR materials
2019-11-06 17:22:47	Groud	I mean, it makes sense to have different trechniques for aliasing, ambiant occlusion, etc... but having some many different results for basic materials is kind of weird
2019-11-06 17:23:01	clayjohn	Akien: hmmm. Okay. I'll look into it this weekend.
2019-11-06 17:23:03	Calinou	unfortunately, PBR is not the universal standard we initially hoped for :(
2019-11-06 17:23:21	clayjohn	Groud: it's usually a result of tradeoffs made in the name of optimizations.
2019-11-06 17:25:04	Groud	clayjohn: I guess so, but like, for a basic light and only metalness/roughness materials, it is crazy to have so many differences
2019-11-06 17:25:50	Groud	I mean, it's supposed to be "physically-based", so there should not be crazy differences in the equations ^^
2019-11-06 17:26:08	clayjohn	Groud: eh. It's physically based rendering, not physically correct rendering, so everyone uses slightly different techniques. In this case, it's most likely a different in how the environment map is generated.
2019-11-06 17:26:17	Jummit	I am thinking about adding a download counter to the asset lib. What do you guys think?
2019-11-06 17:26:36	Groud	hmm ok
2019-11-06 17:26:48	Jummit	So you can sort by most/least downloads.
2019-11-06 17:26:58	Groud	Ah yes, if fracteed's examples uses an environment map it makes sense
2019-11-06 17:28:02	clayjohn	Groud: I think it is the environment map. Cause we use the same PBR equations as most people within the actual shaders.
2019-11-06 17:28:45	Groud	the environment map is generated differently for different roughness, is that it ?
2019-11-06 17:29:48	Calinou	Jummit: the asset library is being rewritten, the old code will be thrown away soon :)
2019-11-06 17:30:04	Calinou	I considered implementing a download count, but it can be exploited with relative ease so I'm not sure about it
2019-11-06 17:30:10	Calinou	I do have a voting/comments system though
2019-11-06 17:30:23	Jummit	Ooh, that's nice! I'm looking forward to the new version.
2019-11-06 17:30:45	Calinou	to make the download count less exploitable, one could store the IP address in a database and compare the request IP against it (and only allow 1 download to be counted per day or something), but GDPR says no :P

2019-11-06 17:33:20	Calinou	https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/comments/8icg2j/can_i_still_store_ip_addresses_in_a_database/ says it's OK to do it, as long as it's clearly written in the privacy policy and you get consent somehow (consent sounds difficult for our use case though…)
2019-11-06 17:35:30	Groud	Calinou: What do you use for the new asset library ?
2019-11-06 17:35:54	Calinou	PHP + Laravel, the code is at https://github.com/Calinou/godot-asset-library-laravel :) still a work in progress, but you can already run it locally
2019-11-06 17:36:17	Groud	The problem with IP addresses is that they are not a reliable way to identify a user
2019-11-06 17:36:36	Groud	ok
2019-11-06 17:36:43	Calinou	yeah, someone with access to many VPNs could still inflate download counts. There's no perfect way to prevent it, I just want to avoid the case where a random user spams F5 on their own asset download link
2019-11-06 17:37:20	Groud	But honestly, I would not worry so much about that
2019-11-06 17:37:23	Groud	You could count the file only once it's fully downloaded
2019-11-06 17:37:53	Groud	Ah maybe put a timer on a per-IP basic
2019-11-06 17:38:03	Groud	like 30 minutes
2019-11-06 17:38:48	Calinou	we don't know when the user finishes downloading the file, or even if they finished it in the first place. Tracking downloads is done by setting up a controller that increments a counter in the database, and redirects the user to the actual download link (this is done transparently in the web browser)
2019-11-06 17:38:57	Calinou	oh also, for this to work, the HTTP client used by Godot needs to follow redirects
2019-11-06 17:39:14	Calinou	if it currently doesn't do this, it means we'd have to supply a point release for all supported Godot releases just for this
2019-11-06 17:43:32	Calinou	so yeah, I'll focus on other features first, the review system should make it easier for users to find good assets in the first place
2019-11-06 17:43:36	Calinou	plus the tagging system which I added :)
2019-11-06 17:44:42	lawnjelly	with that GDPR thing it's open to interpretation
2019-11-06 17:45:00	lawnjelly	i haven't read it but surely they mean storing a longterm evil database a la google or facebook
2019-11-06 17:45:11	lawnjelly	you need to store an IP for lots of things to run a server..
2019-11-06 17:45:23	lawnjelly	in the short term, so where does short term end?
2019-11-06 17:45:44	lawnjelly	I'd say a few hours or a day is hard to argue against
2019-11-06 17:46:32	lawnjelly	even an hour would put most people off
2019-11-06 17:47:05	Calinou	24 hours would be better, as the download count should usually reflect how many people are interested in the asset
2019-11-06 17:47:15	Groud	Calinou: Will you implement a way to specify a list of compatible versions ?
2019-11-06 17:47:18	clayjohn	Groud: essentially yea. Each amount of roughness has a different layer in a mipmap.
2019-11-06 17:47:35	Calinou	Groud: yeah, that's been done, you can have multiple versions per asset, each with their own supported Godot version
2019-11-06 17:47:36	Groud	clayjohn: ok :)
2019-11-06 17:47:50	Groud	great :)
2019-11-06 17:47:56	Calinou	right now, the Godot version is major.minor, but I plan to add full support for semver ranges so you can be more accurate (or more lenient) in terms of version support
2019-11-06 17:47:57	minraws	Groud: a full size dependency manager for assets sounds good
2019-11-06 17:48:00	Groud	Is there a demo avaiable somewhere ?
2019-11-06 17:48:11	Calinou	since not everyone understands semver strings (it's not easy), I'll add templates that you can click to fill the form automatically
2019-11-06 17:48:16	Groud	awesome
2019-11-06 17:48:27	Calinou	like ^3.1 to support 3.1 up to 4.0 (exclusive)
2019-11-06 17:48:35	Groud	minraws: honestly, I think dependency management for game asset is overkill
2019-11-06 17:49:02	Calinou	I don't have an hosted demo yet, would be nice to put one up (I could do it on my VPS)

2019-11-06 17:52:20	Calinou	I'm not fond of having a asset store which just clones the official one :(
2019-11-06 17:52:24	Calinou	it can mislead users
2019-11-06 17:52:43	minraws	A proper dependency could probably even have a way to directly import from GitHub (specific branches/tags/commits)...
2019-11-06 17:52:49	Calinou	I guess their plan is to add paid assets, but having assets taken from the official assetlib can be confusing
2019-11-06 17:53:32	Calinou	minraws: I agree having some kind of dependency management would be good, we could have a "dependencies" section in project.godot at the very least with a {package:version} dictionary
2019-11-06 17:53:43	Groud	minraws: Because game assets are rarely dependant on each other

2019-11-06 17:54:15	Calinou	right now, you have to "vendor" your dependencies in your Git repository (which is a waste of space), or tell people to download them manually (inconvenient)
2019-11-06 17:54:25	Calinou	making Godot able to download them when importing the project would be much better for version control
2019-11-06 17:54:29	minraws	Groud: That's true for Unity cause it's all paid/pay walled...
2019-11-06 17:54:53	Calinou	the best compromise you can do right now is having a shell script that does it for you, but a shell script isn't cross-platform :(

2019-11-07 09:33:26	code-xd	What is the best way to make changes to the source code without building that code over and over again?
2019-11-07 09:33:57	code-xd	Is something is written in the documentation then can someone highlight me that?
2019-11-07 09:34:48	Akien	Once you have built everything once, subsequent builds only rebuild what needs to be rebuilt.
2019-11-07 09:34:54	Akien	(incremental builds)
2019-11-07 09:35:23	jfons	morning
2019-11-07 09:35:45	Akien	So if you change code at the end of the dependency chain, it's fast, if you change code with lots of things depending on it, all those things will be recompiled (so changes to `core/` would be slow typically).

2019-11-07 14:45:46	IssueBot	#31427: File dialog gets stuck on the path of the first selected preset in export dialog | https://git.io/fjx7U
2019-11-07 14:46:41	Akien	For me the export file dialog always defaults to the project folder, regardless of previous export paths anyway.
2019-11-07 14:50:56	reduz	this will be very cool
2019-11-07 14:50:59	Akien	Ah now I can kind of reproduce it, I need to reset an export path to then see its export path used in the Export Path selection filedialog

2019-11-08 09:48:37	RevoluPowered	@Calinou: I agree I just though really don't like the thought of a user losing all of their work irrecoverably if this bug is reintroduced again some other way. A cache somewhere would be fine if it wasn't in the project maybe. Maybe even just temp directory somewhere else on the OS to prevent users even being aware of it.
2019-11-08 09:49:13	RevoluPowered	I was just concerned that .Vs completely loses all work irrecoverably
2019-11-08 09:49:26	RevoluPowered	At a gamejam this might be a serious annoyance
2019-11-08 09:50:31	RevoluPowered	Is .Vs a text format?

2019-11-08 10:01:32	RevoluPowered	@Akien: what do you think about it?

2019-11-08 10:02:32	RevoluPowered	If a write fails for a .Vs currently we lose the entire file

2019-11-08 10:02:57	IssueBot	#32511: .vs Visual Script file corrupting to RSCC | https://git.io/JeaNH
2019-11-08 10:05:03	Akien	Well there's no clear steps to reproduce so it's a bit difficult to fix. Most likely it was Windows being a PITA with file access and failing to write to a file due to it being in use somewhere.
2019-11-08 10:05:30	Akien	Like first write adds header, antivirus goes paranoid and checks it, second write fails because antivirus stole the file handle.
2019-11-08 10:06:38	Akien	As I commented there, the crash seen by iFire just means that we don't do enough error checking when loading potentially corrupted compressed files. This should be easy to fix.
2019-11-08 10:06:57	Akien	But fixing whatever failed writing the .vs file's content is a bit more tricky without knowing how to reproduce it.
2019-11-08 10:10:01	Nello	after disabling the 3D Editor and all Spatial nodes in "Manage Editor Features" the Scene panel still offers the option to create a 3D Scene. is this intended or an oversight that i should open an issue for?

2019-11-08 12:04:19	Mux213	from what i understand when MSAA is turned on we create extra buffers for this. if I read the code right the idea is that we render into these buffers and then in post copy the data from the MSAA buffers into the normal framebuffer resolving the anti aliassing.
2019-11-08 12:04:40	Mux213	the bit that I can't figure out is that I can find the copy in post, but I can't seem to find where we tell Godot to actually render into the multisample_fbo instead of the normal fbo, yet it works

2019-11-08 13:40:01	bojidar_bg	reduz: sorry for pinging you, I was wondering if https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/33230 needs fixing, or is it too much of a performance hit to have a stable sort order on YSorted nodes with equal Y coordinates
2019-11-08 13:40:54	reduz	bojidar_bg: yeah i guess that should be fixed, maybe comparing X, then Y?
2019-11-08 13:41:20	reduz	bojidar_bg: i think its a more memory bound operation than CPU, so comparing X and Y should have no cost imo. You can make a small benchmark to test if you want I guess
2019-11-08 13:41:34	reduz	bojidar_bg: sorry I ment comparing Y, then X if they are the same
2019-11-08 13:52:05	bojidar_bg	yeah, that would be a good solution
2019-11-08 13:52:34	bojidar_bg	reduz: maybe add custom sorting axis at the same time? ^^
2019-11-08 13:53:07	reduz	bojidar_bg: i think that could workm but then that means you would need to convert the sort function to a template

2019-11-11 15:05:42	chaosus89	new methods should be implemented to renderer
2019-11-11 15:06:55	Akien	Maybe it's better to close this broad issue as fixed in 3.2, and open a new one specific for uniform arrays?

2019-11-11 16:29:10	iFire	I've been working on a polygon mesh and polygin path plugin with HungryProton. We're revising the code. The new design is to create a bunch of CSG meshes, apply all operation, get the resulting mesh, convex decomposition, -> for each piece of mesh, run it through a lib to tell if the point is inside or not. We're not sure how to tell if the point is inside or not. One approach is to take one of the points and have it be a distance of n away from
2019-11-11 16:29:10	iFire	 the point to implement the is point is inside the mesh. Is there an easier way?
2019-11-11 16:30:39	iFire	found it. https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_geometry.html#class-geometry-method-segment-intersects-convex
2019-11-11 16:38:20	iFire	https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/scene/resources/convex_polygon_shape.cpp#L35 This gives us the lines of the polygons.

2019-11-13 13:22:22	fales[m]	"error: 'format_error_message' was not declared in this scope"
2019-11-13 13:22:53	fales[m]	That function is only available in debug, and it used to be stripped (as part of ERR_EXPLAIN) in release mode
2019-11-13 13:23:23	fales[m]	but with the latest change I think it doesn't properly get stripped and fail to build

2019-11-13 13:31:58	fales[m]	Akien: likely, the message part of the macro should be skipped in release mode (which will also save size by optimizing out all the strings)
2019-11-13 13:32:49	fales[m]	I can think of a macro that calls _err_print_index_error/_err_print_error with empty parameter in release, passing through in debug
2019-11-13 13:32:54	fales[m]	should be easy, I'll have a look
2019-11-13 13:33:33	fales[m]	maybe even just a macro around m_msg...
2019-11-13 13:35:44	Akien	fales[m]: yeah, I guess all macros now need something like that which used to be done for ERR_EXPLAIN: https://hastebin.com/qoxolasaji.php
2019-11-13 13:35:56	Akien	It's a bit ugly though, if you have a prettier idea, that would be good :P

2019-11-13 13:42:51	fales[m]	about the name, maybe `_DEBUG_MSG` instead of `EXPLAIN_MSG`?
2019-11-13 13:44:22	Akien	Makes sense yeah.
2019-11-13 13:47:23	fales[m]	or even `_DEBUG_STR` (since we already have `_STR`? I'm a bit worried about `_` in preprocessor macros, most compiler macros starts with two underscore, but for example GCC says: "All names which begin with two underscores, or an underscore and a capital letter, are reserved for the compiler and library to use as they wish"
2019-11-13 13:50:25	Akien	Well you can go with `DEBUG_MSG` or `DEBUG_STR`, we don't need the underscore.

2019-11-14 11:02:54	jitspoe	Anybody familiar with the animation code? I'm fixing a blending bug, but I want to make sure there's not a reason for it being implemented the way it was.
2019-11-14 11:02:55	jitspoe	Basically, if you play an animation with a long blend time followed by an animation with a short blend time (before the first blend finishes), what should be a short blend is slow.
2019-11-14 11:04:01	jitspoe	Fixed it locally here, but I was curious if there's a reason it blended the animations in reverse order: https://github.com/jitspoe/godot/commit/cc057472e5da1c870fdbe57aa2e606f0f03b6260

2019-11-14 11:19:32	Akien	You can use breakpoints in your debugger to stop execution at a line you're interested in, and then get a backtrace of what calls led to it.
2019-11-14 11:19:50	Akien	Or step line by line into the rest of the code from the breakpoint.
