2019-09-13 14:51:24	reduz	but most should be
2019-09-13 14:51:42	reduz	so at least now I have nice roadmap for the weekend, make this demo work again perfectly
2019-09-13 14:54:40	Groud	You're close to be done :)
2019-09-13 14:56:31	reduz	i want to think that, but still missing so much
2019-09-13 14:57:24	reduz	the last three difficult parts will be GI Probes (which will need to work different), lightmapping (which also needs to work different, and based on jfons work), and particles (yet again, will work different)
2019-09-13 14:58:36	reduz	and next week I need to fix skinning in Godot 3.x so the guys can keep improving things
2019-09-13 14:59:19	reduz	so that leaves me with less than around 3 weeks to do that, which is probably not as much
2019-09-13 14:59:38	reduz	I will try to get GIProbes to work at least so we can have something looking nice for Poland
2019-09-13 14:59:56	Groud	that would be good :)
