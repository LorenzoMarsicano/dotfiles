2019-10-17 11:18:23	yourfate	I just put solder on one of the pads
2019-10-17 11:18:42	yourfate	hold the led there, heat up the solder blob thatps there
2019-10-17 11:18:50	yourfate	then solder the other pads, resolder the first one, done
2019-10-17 11:20:08	yourfate	I generally prefer smd soldering to tht, as I don't have to keep bending stuff, flipping the board, trim ends etc

2019-10-17 11:34:30	armin	i really consider replacing all switches
2019-10-17 11:34:48	armin	kailh box brown come to mind
2019-10-17 11:35:45	armin	would be a pain in the butt to do, but i reckon the end result would be PRETTY nice
2019-10-17 11:42:24	mads-	armin: Do it. Share my suffering
2019-10-17 11:43:44	mads-	yourfate: Maybe I should try that. I feel like I have gotten my technique to work now.
2019-10-17 11:43:50	mads-	smd has been a pain for me
2019-10-17 11:43:57	armin	mads-: hahaha :-)
2019-10-17 11:44:35	armin	my father told me when i was a child "smd isn't hard, you just have to get used to it."

2019-10-17 12:06:10	day	i still prefer smd for the reasons yourfate mentioned
2019-10-17 12:19:12	yourfate	mads-: I usually start by tinning one pad for every component on the board

2019-10-17 12:19:35	yourfate	and then go to town
2019-10-17 12:19:41	yourfate	I did one ergodash half in about 20 min
