2019-07-01 23:20:32	blitzkraft	How about a paw print?
2019-07-01 23:20:42	Syrinxos	I'm out of ideas: I've soldered my Plaid and tested it using a multimeter, but both my linux laptop and windows desktop couldn't recognize it. So I've ordered an ISP programmer just in case the atmega328p was without bootloader 
2019-07-01 23:21:19	Syrinxos	Now the bootloader get flashed on the atmega (or at least avrdude says so), but still the pc doesn't seem to recognize the board
2019-07-01 23:21:28	blitzkraft	Did you check if the board is receiving power?
2019-07-01 23:21:53	Syrinxos	I'm starting to think that the usb is broken, or at least the data pin are
2019-07-01 23:22:16	switchy	ihre, are you getting the boards assembled?
2019-07-01 23:22:57	blitzkraft	Syrinxos: Did you try the board on different computers and different usb ports?
2019-07-01 23:22:59	ihre	i've been looking at that, but definitely not for the first couple
2019-07-01 23:23:19	Syrinxos	blitzkraft: yes, but I'll check everything again as soon as I can now that I've excluded an atmega without bootloader being the cause
2019-07-01 23:23:36	ihre	just jlpcb, the cheapest, to see if i didnt fuck up, if that works, i might get some assembled
2019-07-01 23:23:40	Syrinxos	Don't have a multimeter rn :(

2019-07-09 10:52:23	blitzkraft	I just keep the ASCII art. Feel free to copy mine.
2019-07-09 10:53:01	Squarism	Well my keyboard isnt orthogonal
2019-07-09 10:53:13	blitzkraft	Neither is mine.
2019-07-09 10:53:31	Squarism	Ofcourse I can put in an effort doing the mental transformation myself.
2019-07-09 10:54:15	Squarism	But its 2019. Terminal/monospaced font aint cool no more
2019-07-09 10:54:35	blitzkraft	May be for you. I monospace all the things.
2019-07-09 10:55:47	Squarism	I see a purpose for it. If there are constraints / not possible for graphical representations. But in this case there are no such constraints. All the information is the, it should have been done years ago.
2019-07-09 10:56:54	blitzkraft	Squarism: It's not too difficult. It could probably be automated. Does qmk configurator output json?
2019-07-09 10:57:49	blitzkraft	I am considering writing a script to do that. If that's not been written already.
2019-07-09 10:58:31	Squarism	blitzkraft, QMK configurator seems to accept json as input but nothing else
2019-07-09 10:58:48	Squarism	And theres no transformation from .hex/keymap.c to json

2019-07-09 10:59:01	Squarism	So Its just alla half assed
2019-07-09 10:59:05	Squarism	all
2019-07-09 10:59:40	blitzkraft	.hex to json is not trivial. But keymap.c to json should be.
2019-07-09 10:59:45	switchy	I wouldn't call that half assed, it would take a lot of effort to go backwards
2019-07-09 10:59:45	blitzkraft	Got a sample json to share?
2019-07-09 11:02:20	Squarism	switchy, as I understand it.
2019-07-09 11:03:59	Squarism	There is a 1. matrix position <-> spatial mapping available. 2. There is a matrix position <-> qmk keycode mapping
2019-07-09 11:04:14	Squarism	those 2 would be enough to do the mapping
2019-07-09 11:04:45	Squarism	sure, you can have your C snippets and those will ofcourse not be reflected. But above would be good enough
2019-07-09 11:10:51	Squarism	Actually it seems to be possible to do this is QMK configurator. All thats lacking is exporting your keymap.c to KEYMAP.JSON
2019-07-09 11:11:05	Squarism	(that qmk configurator accepts)
2019-07-09 11:11:36	Squarism	basically the layes <-> keycode arrays in json
2019-07-09 11:11:36	blitzkraft	Yup.
2019-07-09 11:11:50	blitzkraft	It's same in the keymap.c too.
2019-07-09 11:15:15	Squarism	blitzkraft, not sure I mean what you meant there?
2019-07-09 11:16:28	blitzkraft	The layout is a "array-like" data structure.
2019-07-09 11:16:44	blitzkraft	And each layer is one such struct.

2019-07-10 09:19:44	blitzkraft	What reason did you find?
2019-07-10 09:20:14	blitzkraft	I never tried/used it. But I have a strong negative bias towards it.
2019-07-10 09:22:24	switchy	blitzkraft, it wanted to update the other day, so I did. now I'm trying to install a new package into my environment, and I can't because of a weird dependency conflict on a completely unrelated packgae
2019-07-10 09:22:31	switchy	it also takes well over a minute to tell me this
2019-07-10 09:23:26	blitzkraft	Is it required? From what I understand, it "like" virtual env. Right?
2019-07-10 09:25:03	switchy	no, I don't think it is required
2019-07-10 09:25:18	switchy	but it was the easiest ways to get all the dependencies for this particular library I'm investigating
2019-07-10 09:29:26	switchy	https://www.anaconda.com/why-we-removed-the-free-channel-in-conda-4-7/ looks like I'm hitting this
2019-07-10 09:29:40	switchy	would be nice if that popped up as a warning say...anywhere
2019-07-10 09:29:48	switchy	pre-update, post-update, running the tool, anything

2019-07-10 09:31:08	Syrinxos	I surrender to my Plaid. Soldering looks good, power arrive to the atmega, the bootloader has been flashed but none of my pc will recognize it as an usb device. Not even as an unrecognized device
2019-07-10 09:32:29	blitzkraft	May be the cable is faulty?

2019-07-10 09:46:31	blitzkraft	You can check what happens using `watch -n 1 "dmesg | tail"` -- run the command and connect the keyboard, put it into dfu mode.
2019-07-10 09:47:21	blitzkraft	Also, your issue *could* be caused by flashing wrong firmware/bootloader for the chip.

2019-07-10 10:45:27	Syrinxos	I'll look into it tonight, but tbh I can't remember seeing that option on avrdude UI (on windows)
2019-07-10 10:45:49	Syrinxos	After flashing it says something along the lines of "X bytes of flash were written correctly"
2019-07-10 10:48:15	blitzkraft	Are you sure you don't have any other serial devices connected at all? Could you run the program as administrator?
2019-07-10 10:55:18	Syrinxos	Well, I have my other keyboard, but I'm pretty sure I'm not flashing that lol I'll try running it as an administrator tho
2019-07-10 11:01:57	blitzkraft	On a different note, I picked up a discarded indoor lamp and found the reason it was discarded. Faulty wires inside the stem.

2019-07-10 11:04:25	blitzkraft	And as reported by my multimeter, the return was not connected. And I was too stubborn to give up.

2019-07-10 22:39:00	Syrinxos	Good evening you all!
2019-07-10 22:39:59	Syrinxos	blitzkraft: I've tried the command you suggested this morning (maybe it wasn't morning for you, but still) and yes! The plaid is seen by my computer, but it can't enumerate it as it doesn't respond to setup address
2019-07-10 22:40:17	Syrinxos	At this point I think I might have broken a trace on the pcb
2019-07-10 22:40:39	Syrinxos	Or that something is fried up
2019-07-10 22:47:39	blitzkraft	Can you post the log/errors you saw?
2019-07-10 22:50:15	Syrinxos	https://paste.ee/p/qWRHJ
2019-07-10 22:50:58	Syrinxos	But at this point there is no doubt it is an hardware issue
2019-07-10 22:51:20	Syrinxos	When I'll have time I'll try to look for broken traces but I am not having too much hope
2019-07-10 22:51:26	Syrinxos	Thanks for the help anyway :3
2019-07-10 22:58:00	blitzkraft	No problem. BTW, does this happen even when in dfu mode?
2019-07-10 22:58:55	Syrinxos	IF it really goes in DFU mode yes, same errors

2019-07-12 12:09:44	Joe	it's a PITA here, parts are sorta hard to get because pontiac is gone in the USA
2019-07-12 12:10:05	Joe	and only the GTO & G8 have parts in common, more or less.
2019-07-12 12:10:47	switchy	they're everywhere here

2019-07-12 12:14:01	Joe	switchy: oh i'm sure, here under the pontiac brand they are pretty scarce, not really but enough to be a pain.
2019-07-12 12:14:26	switchy	don't they share any parts with other gm brands?
2019-07-12 12:14:32	Joe	The latest pain was a wiper transmission.... the bushing were made out of unobtainium.
2019-07-12 12:14:37	switchy	every other holden is just a chevvy
2019-07-12 12:15:03	Joe	yes alot of the parts are shared, but some are unique to that chassis.
2019-07-12 12:16:03	Joe	and the odd ball ones are the ones i've been dealing with...... the car only has 35k on it but it has several failure modes.
2019-07-12 12:16:17	Joe	drive it for the afternoon and fix it the next day
2019-07-12 12:16:18	Joe	lol

2019-07-23 10:16:43	switchy	it's still very uncomfortable to be cold, you can rug up but there's still exposed skin, it's inconvenient, activities are awkward

2019-07-23 10:45:45	Syrinxos	In our offices we have broken A/C. I'm usually against A/C, but there was 32c in the office with no windows on the outside. We were basically choking
2019-07-23 10:46:25	Syrinxos	So we moved in the Dep. of Computer Science of the University here (as an UNI spin-off we have a room that we can use with other companies)
2019-07-23 10:46:37	Syrinxos	And here sometimes it's even too cold lol
2019-07-23 10:47:32	Joe	25C is fine for an office... 32 is abuse!
2019-07-23 10:53:59	day	Syrinxos: apparently during the last heat wave people with notebooks were allowed to work in the ac'd conference room. To bad if you dont have a notebook, eh? :D
2019-07-23 10:55:34	Syrinxos	Let me guess what type of computer do you have at work...
2019-07-23 10:55:40	Syrinxos	lol

2019-07-23 11:02:35	Syrinxos	In Europe it's not very common tbh. But our office have it.
2019-07-23 11:02:52	Syrinxos	Problem is that it hasn't been turned on since the construction of the building ~5 years ago
2019-07-23 11:03:17	Syrinxos	And when they tried to add fuel to it, stuff got broken

2019-09-10 10:08:11	Exaga	the EU is a dictator and fast turning into a tyrant by the way it is dealing with this brexit shit
2019-09-10 10:08:43	day	ursual was our defense minister before. years of drama and money wasted on "consultants", before that she was family minister. like wut?
2019-09-10 10:08:48	Exaga	i never realised why russia and china, and to some extent america, hates the EU
2019-09-10 10:09:46	Exaga	huh? i thought she was belgian
2019-09-10 10:10:13	Exaga	oh... google says she's german

2019-09-10 10:11:53	Exaga	ursula von der leyens served in the federal government of Germany from 2005 to 2019 as the longest-serving member of Angela Merkel's cabinet
2019-09-10 10:12:00	day	ah
2019-09-10 10:12:21	Exaga	so merkel now has von der leyen as head of the EU

2019-09-10 10:14:36	Exaga	so what i'm saying is... merkel has the EU in her pocket so to speak
2019-09-10 10:15:14	day	Exaga: delay it till Tusk is gone, then you can have w/e you want lol
2019-09-10 10:17:34	Exaga	Von der Leyen once told an interviewer that her dream was “a united states of Europe – run along the lines of the federal states of Switzerland, Germany or the USA”.

2019-09-10 10:19:29	Exaga	but it doesn't matter which country we live in... the public are told what they need to know in order to further compliance
2019-09-10 10:20:19	Exaga	but you can see where this is heading
2019-09-10 10:21:08	Exaga	merkel's germany in the control room at the EU and one of merkel's former long-term staff as head of the EU
2019-09-10 10:22:30	Exaga	think that's called a monopoly
2019-09-10 10:36:29	day	afaik once you join the eu parliament you are no longer part of the national party
2019-09-10 10:37:33	day	that being said, after 14years of bootlicking you probably ....

2019-09-10 10:38:41	Exaga	it just gets messier the deeper you go

2019-09-10 10:40:54	Exaga	i just googled it

2019-09-10 11:09:27	day	that being said, what pisses me of are moves like introducing maut systems for "non nationals", like the germans are trying. we are supposed to push free travel within the eu, not mug our neighbors
2019-09-10 11:16:08	Exaga	day: the eu started as a trade agreement so that goods and customs could move freely between member countries
2019-09-10 11:16:29	Exaga	it should have stayed as that
2019-09-10 11:17:39	Exaga	back in 1946/7 Winston Churchill suggested a "United states of Europe"
2019-09-10 11:18:29	Exaga	Winston Churchill is also VERY VERY VERY VERY well known in this country to have said, "If Britiain must choose between Europe and the open sea, it must always be the sea."
2019-09-10 11:18:49	Exaga	Churchill was a politician
2019-09-10 11:19:10	Exaga	we are an island
2019-09-10 11:19:18	Exaga	day: you're right :D
2019-09-10 11:19:18	day	well the guy knew a world long gone, those quotes should be consumed with a grain of salt
2019-09-10 11:19:48	Exaga	day: what i'm saying is... who cares what politicians say
2019-09-10 11:19:56	Exaga	they will say whatever suits them
2019-09-10 11:20:01	Exaga	or most of them
2019-09-10 11:23:03	Exaga	but that last link i gave you, the dutch politician is confirming what i've been saying about the EU for the past ~3 years

2019-09-10 12:13:12	eising	so how about them mechanical keyboards, eh?
2019-09-10 12:13:44	Exaga	eising: i'll be picking my switches up in a couple of hours
2019-09-10 12:13:54	eising	ooh, what switches again?
2019-09-10 12:13:59	Exaga	gateron brown
2019-09-10 12:14:21	eising	right,  yeah. So the browns are non-clicky but tactile, right?
2019-09-10 12:14:26	Exaga	yep
2019-09-10 12:14:49	Exaga	to me there's no difference in cherry or gateron and gateron were half the cost of cherry
2019-09-10 12:14:53	eising	nice. I'm really enjoying my zilents v2. I think they are a bit comparable
2019-09-10 12:15:42	Exaga	these should have been delivered yesterday but the postman left a card saying "too big to fit through the letterbox"
2019-09-10 12:15:49	eising	They are really perfect for office use, although still a bit on the sensitive side. I still mistype a bit compared to what I do on the blues
2019-09-10 12:15:52	Exaga	knocking on my fucking door might have solved that one!
2019-09-10 12:15:56	eising	haha
2019-09-10 12:15:57	eising	yeah
2019-09-10 12:16:00	eising	that's the post for you
2019-09-10 12:16:26	Exaga	i made a complaint to the royal mail. they agree with me and will investigate and have promised "better service in future"
2019-09-10 12:16:45	eising	It's usually worse with UPS, where I can sit at home, look out the window while at the same time getting a text saying that I wasn't home when they "attempted to deliver my package"
2019-09-10 12:17:17	Exaga	eising: same thing here but UPS are good. it's DPD, Hermes, and Yodel who are the worst
2019-09-10 12:17:44	eising	but my last piece of mech keeb stuff is probably arriving any day, a wrist rest that is. Then I have to wait all until February to receive my next orders
2019-09-10 12:17:51	Exaga	DHL are by far the best from the non-Roral Mail bunch
2019-09-10 12:17:55	eising	indeed

2019-09-10 12:32:21	Exaga	oh geez... razer are now making their own microswitches for mice
2019-09-10 12:32:23	Exaga	https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Viper-Ultralight-Ambidextrous-Gaming/dp/B07TT8G59J
2019-09-10 12:33:07	Exaga	i bet they claim these razer microswitches are 20-35% more cycles than omron or kailh
2019-09-10 12:36:24	Exaga	* Faster Than Traditional Mechanical Switches: New Razer optical mouse switches uses light beam-based actuation, registering button presses at the speed of light for complete immersion and absolute control
2019-09-10 12:37:05	Exaga	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tw-2MptLL._SL1500_.jpg
2019-09-10 12:37:11	Exaga	they look like regular switches to me
2019-09-10 12:37:24	Exaga	except the plunger is purple
2019-09-10 12:43:11	Exaga	eising: main difference between the cherry and gateron switches is the position of the LED holes
2019-09-10 12:43:22	eising	right
2019-09-10 12:43:27	Exaga	otherwise i cannot feel any differnce when i'm typing
