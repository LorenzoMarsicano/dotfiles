2019-10-17 17:24:30	simonpatapon	yes its gnome
2019-10-17 17:24:39	blitzkraft	Neat. I need to find out how.
2019-10-17 17:24:47	simonpatapon	are you used to bitlbee
2019-10-17 17:24:51	blitzkraft	Also, the tree view- I need that too.
2019-10-17 17:25:10	blitzkraft	I am using bitlbee. I use it with steam, gchat and at one point facebook too.
2019-10-17 17:25:27	simonpatapon	ok so you have it compiled with libpurple

2019-10-18 13:08:46	monotux	most keyboards uses the atmega32u4 nowadays right?
2019-10-18 13:09:19	oddie	Yeah looks like it
2019-10-18 13:09:51	oddie	Maybe it's my actual computer... I have had USB issues in the past, I will  try my other laptop
2019-10-18 13:10:39	monotux	what is (not) happening?
2019-10-18 13:14:12	oddie	`avrdude: butterfly_recv(): programmer is not responding` errors... also cannot verify. Using command `sudo make redox/rev1:default:avrdude` plugging in the left side and pressing reset, it then picks it up and starts writting and durring that process it throws those not responding errors, but sometimes makes it to 100%. Right side however I can flash, with errors as well but I get a keymapping from

2019-10-18 13:16:45	monotux	my iris can have several configurations, as in left or right as masters, or a configuration in which both can act as masters. which setup are you using_
2019-10-18 13:18:00	monotux	it's been a while since I last flashed my iris, but I like to recall that I flash only the right side when it's master, and the left side will be flashed as well. with one dedicated master the other microcontroller just acts like a IO-expander.
2019-10-18 13:18:12	monotux	but I probably remember incorrectly
2019-10-18 13:18:33	oddie	so you flash them seperate?
2019-10-18 13:18:39	oddie	not plugged in?
2019-10-18 13:18:49	monotux	as I recall it I only flash one side
2019-10-18 13:19:10	monotux	but having the TRRS cable connected to the other half
2019-10-18 13:19:18	monotux	but this might be incorrect, it's been a while
2019-10-18 13:19:54	monotux	but if you tried with a new microcontroller on the left side and still had the same issue then the probability of having two broken microcontrollers in a row is low
2019-10-18 13:20:08	monotux	it's probably still a risk but sounds unlikely
2019-10-18 13:20:15	monotux	but I'm not sure I read your problem right
2019-10-18 13:23:16	oddie	hmmm, thanks. I just cannot seem to find HOW you actually flash. It says to configure it and I have just found a video that soemone has flashed it and only selected right as the master
2019-10-18 13:23:35	oddie	let me try again with how they have it configured

2019-10-25 14:15:30	rmk0	ello. on the classic old IBM keyboards, some keys are light grey and others are dark grey. i know IBM, at least from that period, never did anything without thinking about it for a year or so beforehand, so i assume that the decision as to what keys were light and what keys were dark wouldn't have been arbitrary. i can't find any documentation on this though...
2019-10-25 14:15:57	rmk0	any idea as to what organizing principle was used to decide which keys were assigned each color?
2019-10-25 14:42:44	armin	rmk0: the only thing i can think of is visually being able to tell some groups of keys apart
2019-10-25 14:43:04	armin	rmk0: that is, alphanumerics from modifiers for example, or quickly being able to tell f1-f4 apart from f5-f8, etc.
2019-10-25 14:43:29	armin	rmk0: in fact, that's something that most keyboard manufacturers still do, and it has influenced basically all keycap makers that followed
2019-10-25 14:44:04	armin	rmk0: but apart from being able to see those segmentation, i can't think of a good reason why one would do this
2019-10-25 14:44:06	rmk0	armin: it does seem that way. i can't determine any single category that all of the dark keys belong to... i think they just flattened multiple categories into one "dark key" group
2019-10-25 14:45:13	armin	rmk0: no it doesn't work like that, i think it's just grouping some keys so the form a visual group that differentiates from the surroundings. you could as well just make the alphanumerics dark and the mods bright and it won't negatively affect the usability here.
2019-10-25 14:45:35	armin	rmk0: citation needed, but i think that's what the initial idea was about.
2019-10-25 14:45:56	armin	s/the/they/
2019-10-25 14:46:29	armin	basically all the modern keysets have that
2019-10-25 14:52:16	armin	rmk0: https://i.redd.it/eojcojqepsv01.jpg
2019-10-25 14:52:42	armin	rmk0: looking at that for example, it's very fast to point your finger onto the f6 key without having to count all the way from the left
2019-10-25 14:52:51	rmk0	yep! makes sense
2019-10-25 14:53:17	armin	:-)
2019-10-25 14:53:31	armin	i *THINK* that was the reason :-)

2019-10-25 16:29:01	thblt	A partial explanation may be that lighter keys are more readable, which means character input keys get the light color.  The f-keys may be for visual constitency: since alphanums are light,  the leftmost modifiers are dark, and so is ESC, so f1-f4 are light, which makes  them match the arrow and movement block

2019-11-15 17:24:33	blitzkraft	festerB: checkout kbdfans. They have 75% iso pcbs
2019-11-15 17:25:07	blitzkraft	Also, vortex pok3er series has an iso variant.
2019-11-15 17:31:50	festerB	blitzkraft: Will do, any web you recommend to buy from? Is pcbs something I'd need to solder, bacause that's way out of my skillset? ;)
2019-11-15 17:32:06	ShinyRice	yes
2019-11-15 17:32:14	ShinyRice	you absolutely need to solder
2019-11-15 17:32:37	ShinyRice	though I'm not sure if you need to do that if you socket your switches
2019-11-15 17:32:41	blitzkraft	I see. There are hotswap options.
2019-11-15 17:33:02	blitzkraft	I'm pretty sure kbdfans also has a 75% hotswap pcb.
2019-11-15 17:33:15	blitzkraft	They don't need soldering.
2019-11-15 17:33:26	ShinyRice	like, obviously I mean that the sockets may or may not need to be soldered, the key switches don't ever need to be soldered like this
2019-11-15 17:41:58	festerB	Hmm looks like kbdfans only have 60-68% in iso layout - dang - they do have assembly service so not soldering might be ok

2019-11-18 15:01:42	Joe	i feel like nothing has improved over 6k processors and 4k resolution, other than the addition of usb-c. While i get the "improvement" it really doesn't fit most people's usecase.

2019-11-26 11:04:36	switchy	day, 32
2019-11-26 11:05:48	day	disappointing! D:
2019-11-26 11:06:54	day	but i guess more isnt really feasable on the non hedt platforms thanks to the dual channel interface
2019-11-26 11:07:22	switchy	day, yeah, if I need more ram I'll just run stuff on hpc
2019-11-26 11:09:36	day	you mean a rented VM?
2019-11-26 11:10:10	switchy	day, no I mean an hpc facility
2019-11-26 11:10:24	day	yeah but i doubt you have one in your basement ^^
2019-11-26 11:10:41	switchy	heh, true, but I have access to one :)
2019-11-26 11:11:13	day	everyone does. just most have to pay by the minute :p
2019-11-26 11:11:44	switchy	poor people
2019-11-26 11:12:21	switchy	well, I do have to pay, just imaginary supercomputer bucks
2019-11-26 11:13:03	day	i would love to see the booking schedule of a supercomputer tbh
2019-11-26 11:13:13	day	i bet theres so much bullshit being done on them
2019-11-26 11:13:37	switchy	heh, whenever I look at the queue it's mostly computational chemistry
2019-11-26 11:13:40	switchy	booooring
2019-11-26 11:14:14	day	same goes for spacebased sensor equipment
2019-11-26 11:14:46	day	well stuff may sound boring but that doesnt mean it's sensible work :)
2019-11-26 11:15:03	day	it's not*
2019-11-26 11:15:04	switchy	true, it's just not interesting in a supercomputer sense
2019-11-26 11:15:31	switchy	multi-thousand core jobs are more fun
2019-11-26 11:16:09	switchy	5180 cores, 2.65TB ram in use on one
2019-11-26 11:16:33	day	arent all hpc tasks large parallelized? i would assume the single threading performance of these things is terrible
2019-11-26 11:17:14	switchy	ideally, but some people just use it as a big pool of cores for single thread jobs
2019-11-26 11:17:40	switchy	I actually don't know how computational chemistry codes work to be honest
2019-11-26 11:17:51	switchy	or anything much outside my domain :P

2019-12-13 10:16:13	PCoves	At line 35, it's also possible to use sprintf and build a more complex color code including background color.
2019-12-13 10:16:32	PCoves	But then there is a noticeable lag.
2019-12-13 10:17:03	PCoves	Also, I gave the random color a try, worst lag.
2019-12-13 10:17:43	mads-	switchy: C++. You?
2019-12-13 10:18:05	PCoves	And, the (line 30) mods save is here to be able to type capitalized letters without screwing the color code.
2019-12-13 10:18:16	switchy	mads-, racket and fortran
2019-12-13 10:19:19	switchy	PCoves, there's noticeable lag using sprintf?
2019-12-13 10:20:46	PCoves	No, but every tapped key has to output between 5 and 8 chars.
2019-12-13 10:20:46	mads-	switchy: nice :D I haven't tried racket. Is it any fun?
2019-12-13 10:20:54	blitzkraft	Does color need to be enabled on the channel? PCoves : Could you type in a color message here??
2019-12-13 10:21:20	PCoves	Like this?
2019-12-13 10:21:41	PCoves	It's more on the client side I suppose.
2019-12-13 10:21:43	switchy	I think +c disables them
2019-12-13 10:22:01	PCoves	Ho, you guys don't see them.
2019-12-13 10:22:06	day	no
2019-12-13 10:22:09	 *	PCoves is kind of sad.
2019-12-13 10:22:29	PCoves	https://freenode.net/kb/answer/channelmodes Indeed, +c disables colors.
2019-12-13 10:22:35	switchy	I *could* enable them... but that could be anarchy
2019-12-13 10:22:46	PCoves	Please don't.
2019-12-13 10:22:53	PCoves	It's of no importance.
2019-12-13 10:23:10	PCoves	I like anarchy though.
2019-12-13 10:23:17	day	but i want to use my rainbow plugin :|
2019-12-13 10:23:35	PCoves	But I guess you did not refered to the political one.

2019-12-13 10:28:31	day	so with the int code challenges, are they all based on the previous one, or do you keep reusing the first version of it?
2019-12-13 10:28:57	day	A->B, A->C, A-D vs. A->B->C->D ?
2019-12-13 10:29:06	switchy	the former
2019-12-13 10:29:16	switchy	well, you add more opcodes a few times, and then just use it as-is
2019-12-13 10:31:03	switchy	I think the one where you finish the interpreter is basically a program that verifies your interpreter is correct
2019-12-13 10:33:50	mads-	switchy: That's pretty nice
2019-12-13 10:34:00	mads-	Seems like a lot of work goes into that challenge.

2019-12-16 14:57:39	day	switchy: solved today?
2019-12-16 14:58:12	day	im curious, does part two require trickery? did you run into any performance constrains?
2019-12-16 15:02:17	day	im reasonably sure my haskell logic is fine, but im not getting a result, probably because it needs more resources than i have ^_^

2019-12-18 10:06:39	switchy	day, yeah I am doing badly
2019-12-18 10:06:56	switchy	I have a vague idea
2019-12-18 10:10:51	day	the 1d example i was thinking nice, its just like decoding  a math formula
2019-12-18 10:10:58	day	but then the 2d stuff...nope

2019-12-18 10:13:58	switchy	day, surely the same principle would apply
2019-12-18 10:16:02	day	dont think so, due to the "shortest way" thing
2019-12-18 10:16:48	day	im thinking combining it with a tree, and choosing the shortest route? but the example is probably gigantic again to prevent that?

2019-12-18 10:18:59	switchy	I don't think there are any cycles though
2019-12-18 10:20:26	switchy	maybe there are...
2019-12-18 10:31:59	Joe	so, so far this guy seems alright witht he tofu cases.
2019-12-18 10:32:49	Joe	answered pretty quickly on reddit and was polite and professional, i ordered the case from his shopify and he says he will 2 day express it tomorrow.
2019-12-18 10:33:44	Joe	doesn't seem like a guy who wants to sell cases as much as someone holding inventory from a group buy, i could be wrong about that tho.

2019-12-18 11:10:06	day	yeah me neither. i just realized i misunderstood the task. i thought the goal was to find the key without a matching door, in which case i could at least order the doors recursively
2019-12-18 11:10:39	switchy	gotta get all the keys, right?
2019-12-18 11:10:47	day	yes
2019-12-18 11:11:36	switchy	it's like a hamiltonian path, but with extra steps

2019-12-18 11:38:26	switchy	we're off-grid, ac is too power hungry

2019-12-18 11:45:34	day	ah ok
2019-12-18 11:45:43	day	i thought you are in the middle of nowhere :D
2019-12-18 11:45:50	switchy	haha, thankfully not
2019-12-18 11:46:05	switchy	just some space in the country, but close enough to work and have city facilities
2019-12-18 11:46:20	day	but crazy that you dont have access to the power grid :|
2019-12-18 11:46:32	day	15mins is nothing
2019-12-18 11:46:53	switchy	there are some power poles along our road, it's just crazy expensive to get new ones installed to the house
2019-12-18 11:46:55	day	friend of mine isnt connected to the water grid, but they have power
2019-12-18 11:47:23	switchy	that seems pretty reasonable
2019-12-18 11:47:55	day	yeah its alright. they have their own water treatment thingie
2019-12-18 11:48:32	switchy	only bad thing is when you're in a drought...
2019-12-18 11:48:41	day	which is basically just an artificial little pond (maybe tennis field size)
2019-12-18 11:49:45	switchy	for drinking water?
2019-12-18 11:49:45	day	we dont have droughts. at worst it doesnt rain for a few weeks, but theres still "unlimited" water from the ground
2019-12-18 11:50:02	day	they are connected to a pump that belongs to a group of houses i believe
2019-12-18 11:50:15	day	which just pumps up groundwater
2019-12-18 11:51:14	switchy	aha, interesting
2019-12-18 11:54:05	switchy	not on the water mains, but still close enough to others to be on the same water supply anyway
2019-12-18 11:55:25	day	yeah. they pay flat fee, which just covers the maintainance/electricity. so their water is dirt cheap
2019-12-18 11:57:01	switchy	sounds like their water isn't far removed from dirt anyway :D
2019-12-18 11:57:35	day	nah it is perfectly fine and drinkable
2019-12-18 12:02:35	switchy	there is a truly unfathomable amount of beetles on my flyscreen
