2019-10-17 17:23:01	simonpatapon	why you say adventurous
2019-10-17 17:23:39	blitzkraft	Ok - i need your weechat config. and setup.
2019-10-17 17:23:53	blitzkraft	How did you get SMS in there?
2019-10-17 17:24:01	simonpatapon	yes
2019-10-17 17:24:08	simonpatapon	with bitlbeeà

2019-10-17 17:24:21	simonpatapon	and pulsesms-libpurple
2019-10-17 17:24:30	simonpatapon	yes its gnome
2019-10-17 17:24:39	blitzkraft	Neat. I need to find out how.
2019-10-17 17:24:47	simonpatapon	are you used to bitlbee
2019-10-17 17:24:51	blitzkraft	Also, the tree view- I need that too.
2019-10-17 17:25:10	blitzkraft	I am using bitlbee. I use it with steam, gchat and at one point facebook too.
2019-10-17 17:25:27	simonpatapon	ok so you have it compiled with libpurple

2019-10-17 17:27:22	keveloper	simonpatapon: does pulsesms have to be your default sms app for this to work?

2019-10-18 13:08:46	monotux	most keyboards uses the atmega32u4 nowadays right?
2019-10-18 13:09:19	oddie	Yeah looks like it
2019-10-18 13:09:51	oddie	Maybe it's my actual computer... I have had USB issues in the past, I will  try my other laptop
2019-10-18 13:10:39	monotux	what is (not) happening?
2019-10-18 13:14:12	oddie	`avrdude: butterfly_recv(): programmer is not responding` errors... also cannot verify. Using command `sudo make redox/rev1:default:avrdude` plugging in the left side and pressing reset, it then picks it up and starts writting and durring that process it throws those not responding errors, but sometimes makes it to 100%. Right side however I can flash, with errors as well but I get a keymapping from

2019-10-18 13:16:45	monotux	my iris can have several configurations, as in left or right as masters, or a configuration in which both can act as masters. which setup are you using_
2019-10-18 13:18:00	monotux	it's been a while since I last flashed my iris, but I like to recall that I flash only the right side when it's master, and the left side will be flashed as well. with one dedicated master the other microcontroller just acts like a IO-expander.
2019-10-18 13:18:12	monotux	but I probably remember incorrectly
2019-10-18 13:18:33	oddie	so you flash them seperate?
2019-10-18 13:18:39	oddie	not plugged in?
2019-10-18 13:18:49	monotux	as I recall it I only flash one side
2019-10-18 13:19:10	monotux	but having the TRRS cable connected to the other half
2019-10-18 13:19:18	monotux	but this might be incorrect, it's been a while
2019-10-18 13:19:54	monotux	but if you tried with a new microcontroller on the left side and still had the same issue then the probability of having two broken microcontrollers in a row is low
2019-10-18 13:20:08	monotux	it's probably still a risk but sounds unlikely
2019-10-18 13:20:15	monotux	but I'm not sure I read your problem right
2019-10-18 13:23:16	oddie	hmmm, thanks. I just cannot seem to find HOW you actually flash. It says to configure it and I have just found a video that soemone has flashed it and only selected right as the master
2019-10-18 13:23:35	oddie	let me try again with how they have it configured

2019-10-25 14:15:30	rmk0	ello. on the classic old IBM keyboards, some keys are light grey and others are dark grey. i know IBM, at least from that period, never did anything without thinking about it for a year or so beforehand, so i assume that the decision as to what keys were light and what keys were dark wouldn't have been arbitrary. i can't find any documentation on this though...
2019-10-25 14:15:57	rmk0	any idea as to what organizing principle was used to decide which keys were assigned each color?
2019-10-25 14:42:44	armin	rmk0: the only thing i can think of is visually being able to tell some groups of keys apart
2019-10-25 14:43:04	armin	rmk0: that is, alphanumerics from modifiers for example, or quickly being able to tell f1-f4 apart from f5-f8, etc.
2019-10-25 14:43:29	armin	rmk0: in fact, that's something that most keyboard manufacturers still do, and it has influenced basically all keycap makers that followed
2019-10-25 14:44:04	armin	rmk0: but apart from being able to see those segmentation, i can't think of a good reason why one would do this
2019-10-25 14:44:06	rmk0	armin: it does seem that way. i can't determine any single category that all of the dark keys belong to... i think they just flattened multiple categories into one "dark key" group
2019-10-25 14:45:13	armin	rmk0: no it doesn't work like that, i think it's just grouping some keys so the form a visual group that differentiates from the surroundings. you could as well just make the alphanumerics dark and the mods bright and it won't negatively affect the usability here.
2019-10-25 14:45:35	armin	rmk0: citation needed, but i think that's what the initial idea was about.
2019-10-25 14:45:56	armin	s/the/they/
2019-10-25 14:46:29	armin	basically all the modern keysets have that
2019-10-25 14:52:16	armin	rmk0: https://i.redd.it/eojcojqepsv01.jpg
2019-10-25 14:52:42	armin	rmk0: looking at that for example, it's very fast to point your finger onto the f6 key without having to count all the way from the left
2019-10-25 14:52:51	rmk0	yep! makes sense
2019-10-25 14:53:17	armin	:-)
2019-10-25 14:53:31	armin	i *THINK* that was the reason :-)

2019-10-25 16:29:01	thblt	A partial explanation may be that lighter keys are more readable, which means character input keys get the light color.  The f-keys may be for visual constitency: since alphanums are light,  the leftmost modifiers are dark, and so is ESC, so f1-f4 are light, which makes  them match the arrow and movement block
