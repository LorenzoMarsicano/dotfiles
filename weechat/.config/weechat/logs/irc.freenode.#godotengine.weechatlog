2019-09-13 17:51:03	fogine	Hello guys,I'm developing sort of drawing tool and I'm using CanvasItem draw_texture() to draw with "brush". Now I need to rotate the bursh texture. This can be done by draw_set_transform(position, rotation, scale) method.The issue I'm having is that I need to rotate around texture center, not around default global origin which is Vector2.ZEROI
2019-09-13 17:51:03	fogine	tried something like this:func _draw():        draw_set_transform(offset, brush_options.rotation, Vector2.ONE) //where offset is Vector2 offset from (0,0) to center of texture        draw_texture(brush_texture, brush_options.position) // where position is local position of left-top corner of the brush locationThe idea was that by setting transform
2019-09-13 17:51:04	fogine	position to offset vector, the texture will be shifted before its rotated, however this doesnt seem to be correct thinking...Could somebody help please?

2019-10-17 17:27:25	jimbzy	My older brother is a heavy mechanic and he built a machine just for stopping runaways.  It uses a CO2 tank with a solenoid valve that's operated by a tachometer.  If an engine goes above the set RPM's it automatically releases the CO2 directly into the intake and chokes the engine out.

2019-10-18 10:08:42	Calinou	vrav: there's itos() and rtos() to convert integers and reals (floats) to strings in Godot, not sure if you can use that in GDNative
2019-10-18 10:09:12	Calinou	in Godot's codebase, you could do print_line(rtos(vec2.x))
2019-10-18 10:10:56	houkime	vrav at least in C API tutorial there is a section about making an actual godot "variant" from string https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/blob/2f9ffbb5513925ebf30a222d9e9c0aa790f57f55/tutorials/plugins/gdnative/gdnative-c-example.rst

2019-10-18 10:18:46	houkime	As i understood the thing is to interface your own functions and possibly 3rd party libraries with a special limited API which kind of wraps your functions in a gdscript-like form. So you can't really use C++/C classes directly in output but need to translate everything into things gdscript can see.

2019-10-18 10:24:03	houkime	and the same goes for inputs, including the fact that you're given a limited set of engine function pointers that you're allowed to call, i presume your abilities are limited to be the same as those of gdscript.

2019-10-18 10:31:06	houkime	So, in this example as I (probably incorectly) may suggest, what happens is that vec2 is a Godot class that prints normally because it was taken care of by a special c ++ wrapper.
2019-10-18 10:31:28	houkime	but std::string on the other hand is a raw C++ class
2019-10-18 10:32:48	houkime	so trying to Godot::print it might not work.
2019-10-18 10:33:39	houkime	vec2.x might also happen to be a raw c++ float
2019-10-18 10:34:39	houkime	If that's the case, the problem is in the implementation of Godot::print that lacks needed polymorphism.
2019-10-18 10:35:41	Calinou	GDScript doesn't have polymorphism, that might hinder it
2019-10-18 10:35:49	Calinou	unless there's a way to fix it only in the C++ bindings

2019-10-18 10:43:49	houkime	print that is in raw C API cannot print standard C things and needs variants to be explicitly constructed by the programmer. So if there are implicit conversions going on and failing they are probably in c++ bindings.
2019-10-18 10:47:14	houkime	or i am terribly misunderstanding something... which is quite possible.

2019-10-18 11:35:10	houkime	and "print" actually consumes godot_string like that void (*godot_print)(const godot_string *p_message);
2019-10-18 11:37:51	houkime	(it is a function pointer because the whole API is distributed as a struct of  function pointers)
2019-10-18 11:39:38	houkime	no polymorphism, no nothing, whatever happens with conversions of basillions of possible inputs to godot_string is all in c++ bindings somewhere.

One picks a reference from a value which was passed and then casts the reference into a pointer to godot_string... emmm... my low level programming might not be up to the task to tell what this will _actually_ do.

2019-10-18 13:56:49	houkime	hmm, oh. i am batman again.
2019-10-18 13:57:55	houkime	so basically what happens is that there are two things that are supposed to be similar
2019-10-18 13:58:36	houkime	String from String.hpp which is a cpp class wrapping godot_string.
2019-10-18 13:59:12	houkime	and then godot_string itself.
2019-10-18 13:59:29	houkime	aaaaand there is no explicit conversion between the two!
2019-10-18 14:00:52	houkime	Instead what is done is that you "convert" one from another via reinterpreting a pointer to String as a pointer to godot_string.
2019-10-18 14:02:29	houkime	is this some kind of a widely known wrapping tech? Because it is not evident what provisions there are to ensure that this yields correct results.

2019-10-22 13:10:21	bojidar_bg	note that you have to compile the GDNative library for each of the platforms regardless of what you do, so if doesn't compile, it won't work either
2019-10-22 13:10:22	bojidar_bg	(alright, Android and Linux might share the .so file, but windows would require a .dll)
2019-10-22 13:14:04	DarkUranium	Compiling grep just for that sounds like both overkill *and* a bad idea, though.
2019-10-22 13:14:15	DarkUranium	Plus there's potentially the license issue (depending on what you're doing)
2019-10-22 13:15:00	DarkUranium	What you probably want is something like libpcre. Or one of a myriad of other regex libraries.
2019-10-22 13:19:02	yuken	Huh, I wonder why I can't build Godot...
2019-10-22 13:20:41	yuken	Seems like my error is "Project/ProjectExtensions.cs(2,7): error CS0246: The type or namespace name `DotNet' could not be found. Are you missing an assembly reference? [/home/jason/godot/modules/mono/editor/GodotSharpTools/GodotSharpTools.csproj]" when trying to compile 3.1 with mono, huh.

2019-10-24 15:20:59	--	Sam is now known as Guest48234
2019-10-24 15:22:22	Guest48234	When I try and use my custom build of Godot with Creature Animation module to export using custom templates, Godot crashes on the scene with the CreatureGodot node. It does this without any errors. Is there a way to force Godot to show all errors?
2019-10-24 15:22:51	Calinou	Guest48234: I guess you need to compile a build with debug symbols, run it in a terminal and do the thing until it crashes
2019-10-24 15:22:59	Calinou	you'll get a backtrace which tells you where the error comes from
2019-10-24 15:23:50	Guest48234	To compile with debug symbols, you just check the checkbox at the bottom when exporting? Or is there another place to set Godot to do that? Thanks for responding so quickly!
2019-10-24 15:27:52	Calinou	Guest48234: no, you need to recompile the export template and specify it as a custom template
2019-10-24 15:28:05	Calinou	if you just use a "debug" export template, it may not contain enough debugging symbols to give you an accurate backtrace
2019-10-24 15:28:42	Calinou	still, have you tried runnig it in a terminal? If you're on Windows, you'll see a command prompt appear automatically when starting the debug export template, but this won't be the case on macOS and Linux
2019-10-24 15:28:52	Calinou	running*
2019-10-24 15:29:26	Guest48234	When I run it in the terminal, once I get to the scene with the custom node the terminal and the game just close.
2019-10-24 15:29:45	Guest48234	I'll try compiling a new debug template like you suggested.
2019-10-24 15:31:40	Guest48234	It doesn't crash in the Editor btw...just fyi. So, it must be some sort of build error. I think it's the json file required by Creature. I put *.json in the list of included resources to export but that didn't help. Hopefully I can get a good error with the new template.

2019-10-24 15:35:51	Callmerick	I have a question, I'm working on task scheduling and I wanted to check out how does Godot handle different tasks (AI / Graphism / Audio) and how it manages to schedule at bests. The issue that I have is the number of different implementation on threads and which ones are made to handle the editor and which ones are actually in game dynamic
2019-10-24 15:35:51	Callmerick	scheduling. Does anyone already looked into it? Is there a way to get a full task graph of an execution for example. (Sort of profiling but way more precise)
2019-10-24 15:38:14	Calinou	Guest48234: to double-check whether the .json file is included in the exported data, try exporting a ZIP from the Export dialog
2019-10-24 15:38:22	Calinou	you can then open it with an archive manager and check the contents that are effectively exported
2019-10-24 15:38:33	Calinou	(use the "Export ZIP/PCK" button)
2019-10-24 15:41:09	Guest48234	yea, the json is in there. maybe it's something else. I'll have to redo the debug export template
2019-10-24 15:41:16	Guest48234	thanks for your help
2019-10-24 15:42:42	Calinou	you're welcome :)

2019-10-25 17:42:51	Nello	really cause i even mentioned that it needed some easing and i don't remember you saying it had it
2019-10-25 17:43:00	Nello	maybe it was just a really bad recording
2019-10-25 17:43:18	jimbzy	Yeah it was with that peek program.  I switched to a different recorder and switched to mp4
2019-10-25 17:45:52	jimbzy	I've been using the same tween since I added the camera.  It could also be that I shortened the playing field and I'm not maxing out distance.
2019-10-25 17:47:30	Nello	it mustve been the recording because it's a pretty minor easing
2019-10-25 17:50:13	jimbzy	Yeah.  Anywho, I guess I'm going to run around and spend some money I don't have :D
2019-10-25 17:50:22	jimbzy	I'll be back in a while.

2019-10-29 10:11:46	RangerVermelho	Hi, good morning guys! i trying to find a answer about shader, tried discord and reddit without success... if anyone could help me about i really appreciate. I found a shader for volumetric light on nvidia page. Is a really small piece of code but, i dont know how to use this shader, what node i use this
2019-10-29 10:12:00	RangerVermelho	https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch13.html
2019-10-29 10:12:19	RangerVermelho	here's on this github has frag and vertex:

2019-10-29 10:13:31	Nello	hey RangerVermelho, someone else may come along with a better answer but there's a whole section of the docs dedicated to migrating shaders to the godot shader language
2019-10-29 10:13:34	Nello	https://godot.readthedocs.io/en/3.1/tutorials/shading/migrating_to_godot_shader_language.html
2019-10-29 10:13:47	Nello	i'm new to the engine and gamedev in general so all i can do is link docs :P
2019-10-29 10:15:01	RangerVermelho	Hi Nello! Thanks for the help! Welcome :D  Docs really helpfull, i converted shader with this, but i dont find how to use this shader, because is not a "material" shader
2019-10-29 10:18:09	Nello	oh no if it's not in the docs then it's beyond me! i'm sure someone will stop by so hang around

2019-10-29 17:44:17	Calinou	kimamb: no, I don't think it will be built-in anytime soon
2019-10-29 17:44:27	Calinou	Zylann's terrain editor plugin seems to be the best option so far
2019-10-29 17:44:49	Calinou	the issue with creating a built-in solution is that we'd need to make it cover a large amount of usecases, so it'd become a maintenance burden
2019-10-29 17:45:09	Calinou	terrain is a very vast topic (no pun intended), Unity/Unreal's built-in solutions often leave to be desired for comparison
2019-10-29 17:45:43	Calinou	however, we can make it easier to extend Godot to build plugins of this type
2019-10-29 17:46:01	Calinou	(Godot 4.0 will make it possible to override parts of the renderer in scripts, and will offer a compute API for this purpose)

2019-10-30 10:39:02	Nello	busy life
2019-10-30 10:39:10	Nello	how are you implementing attacks?
2019-10-30 10:39:37	Sagirou	I havent quite figured out how signals, area2ds, and groups work together to have basic combat and damage yet
2019-10-30 10:39:51	Nello	which part is giving your trouble?
2019-10-30 10:40:06	Sagirou	Not sure yet. Dont know how to do it so i dont know how im gonna use it
2019-10-30 10:40:24	Sagirou	for the main project were doing its going to be just a swipe attack for a cat
2019-10-30 10:40:35	Nello	what's your character? an animatedsprite or a kinematicbody2d?
2019-10-30 10:40:39	Nello	oh or is it 3d
2019-10-30 10:40:48	Sagirou	2d
2019-10-30 10:41:02	Sagirou	the cats kinematic with an animated sprite
2019-10-30 10:42:08	Sagirou	Im guessing it needs an are 2d that sends a signal to the mice and i supposed i can code the hurt animation for the mice when it enters it but beyond that and coding the animation itself im totally lost lol
2019-10-30 10:43:12	Nello	the benefit of never clearing my browser history: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaJopFFkmNo
2019-10-30 10:44:05	Sagirou	that doesnt help too much
2019-10-30 10:44:12	Sagirou	im not using a tiled sprite
2019-10-30 10:44:38	Sagirou	plus ive already watched it and know of it
2019-10-30 10:44:45	Sagirou	kind of what im trying to go off of already

2019-10-30 10:47:26	Nello	the AnimatedSprite node has get_frame() so if you want the hitbox to appear at a certain time you could have it if anim.get_frame() == target: area2d.set_monitoring(1)
2019-10-30 10:48:41	Nello	that would enable the area2d/hitbox at the right frame. i guess you could add and remove the hitbox instead of enabling/disabling it
2019-10-30 10:49:31	Nello	especially if you have different attacks
2019-10-30 10:55:47	Sagirou	Nah its just a cat swipe lol
2019-10-30 10:56:29	Sagirou	I guess i could disable it on 0 and then enable it briefly when the attack finishes
2019-10-30 10:58:40	Nello	yeah you can specify which frames the hitbox is active and if you don't want to enable/disable it you can store the hitbox node in a variable and add_child/remove_child on the appropriate frames
2019-10-30 11:00:31	Nello	that'd trigger anything you have in _enter_tree and _ready though so whatever works for you
2019-10-30 11:16:17	Sagirou	Hey Nully

2019-10-31 17:29:40	maveerik	or until i swap windows
2019-10-31 17:29:52	maveerik	as if they are out of focus or something

2019-10-31 17:32:51	CombustibleLemon	Is there anything like the record audio effect but more suitable for realtime audio processing and not just recording? I would like to get access to the latest bit of recorded data, but the data of the record effect doesn't refresh often enough, and it seems to be only useful for recording.

2019-11-04 12:09:37	Nello	have you checked out https://godot.readthedocs.io/en/3.1/tutorials/viewports/multiple_resolutions.html
2019-11-04 12:09:49	Nello	there are settings to handle resizing and it makes it super easy
2019-11-04 12:10:35	Nello	in the project settings go display and then window. from there change the mode to window and the aspect to keep
2019-11-04 12:10:57	coldragon	Yes I read that
2019-11-04 12:11:03	coldragon	I use the 2D mode and kee_heigh
2019-11-04 12:11:15	coldragon	So my game always have the same height and just expand in width
2019-11-04 12:11:25	coldragon	But how can I know the virtual size it expanded ?
2019-11-04 12:11:29	Nello	if you absolutely need the window size you can get it with OS.get_real_window_size()
2019-11-04 12:11:50	coldragon	No, the get_viewport().size already give me the real size in pixel of the renderer
2019-11-04 12:11:57	coldragon	I need to know the "virtual" size of the renderer
2019-11-04 12:12:47	coldragon	a sprite that is 400*400 in my 960*560pixel will be scalled to be the same "size" in a 1900*1080 screen
2019-11-04 12:13:01	coldragon	but if the ratio is not the same
2019-11-04 12:13:05	coldragon	it will expand in width
2019-11-04 12:13:31	coldragon	so the "virtual" size of the renderer will be something like 960+X*560
2019-11-04 12:13:52	coldragon	(because I keep the same Height)
2019-11-04 12:14:11	Nello	i'm still confused as to which number you're looking for sorry
2019-11-04 12:15:15	Nello	there's the window size and then there's the viewport size. i already gave you the window size (it's in OS) and you can get the viewport size with get_viewport_rect().size
2019-11-04 12:15:28	Nello	is there some other size you're looking for?
2019-11-04 12:15:34	coldragon	The virtual size
2019-11-04 12:15:56	Nello	does get_viewport_rect().size give you that?
2019-11-04 12:15:58	coldragon	The virtual size of the viewport is scaled to fit the size the viewport can take on the screen
2019-11-04 12:16:07	coldragon	I'm gonna check
2019-11-04 12:17:28	coldragon	get_viewport_rect() doesn't exist
2019-11-04 12:18:34	Nello	i threw print(str(get_viewport_rect().size)) in _process(delta) in my character controller and it worked
2019-11-04 12:19:11	coldragon	in 3.1 ?
2019-11-04 12:19:39	coldragon	it say me it's not declared in current class
2019-11-04 12:20:00	Nello	oh it's part of canvasitem https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/classes/class_canvasitem.html
2019-11-04 12:20:13	coldragon	I'm in a parralaxbackground
2019-11-04 12:21:18	Nello	if your game has a control node or any node2d node pu‎t it in there
2019-11-04 12:21:30	Nello	it just needs to inherit from canvasitem
2019-11-04 12:23:59	coldragon	I tried
2019-11-04 12:24:07	coldragon	it still return the "real" renderer size
2019-11-04 12:24:10	coldragon	and not the logic one :/
2019-11-04 12:26:29	Nello	sorry i don't know what else there is besides actual window size and the viewport size
2019-11-04 12:27:02	coldragon	np
2019-11-04 12:27:05	coldragon	thank's for your help
2019-11-04 12:28:27	Nello	you have keep_height and the project height is 960 right? and the width is 560. so as you resize the height is always 960 because you set it to keep_height
2019-11-04 12:28:37	Nello	and the width changes based on how the window resizes
2019-11-04 12:28:48	Nello	what else are you looking for?

2019-11-04 13:32:50	coldragon	Nello, It was my lunch time sorry. I want the resized width
2019-11-04 13:33:09	coldragon	My height is 540 and my width is something plus or minus 960
2019-11-04 13:33:36	coldragon	But get_viewport() return the final size of the renderer and not the "virtual coordinate"

2019-11-04 13:48:31	coldragon	I tried I get the actual size of the viewport
2019-11-04 13:48:35	Nello	https://streamable.com/5hkfw when i resize the window the height stays the same and the width changes
2019-11-04 13:48:52	Nello	none of the images are stretched/squashed either
2019-11-04 13:49:03	coldragon	Oh
2019-11-04 13:49:08	coldragon	Did i miss something
2019-11-04 13:49:12	coldragon	I try it quickly
2019-11-04 13:49:40	coldragon	Oh sorry i'm dumb. Yeah that's exactly what I needed
2019-11-04 13:49:58	Nello	:D ok good i thought there was some 3rd size out there i didn't know about :P
2019-11-04 13:50:31	coldragon	Hmmm
2019-11-04 13:50:36	coldragon	I remove what I said
2019-11-04 13:50:38	coldragon	it don't work
2019-11-04 13:50:54	coldragon	no wait
2019-11-04 13:51:21	coldragon	it's good
2019-11-04 13:51:30	Nello	what a rollercoaster of emotions
2019-11-04 13:51:30	coldragon	Thank's a lot
2019-11-04 13:51:48	coldragon	Yes. I was not in the good scene when I showed it to a friend
2019-11-04 13:51:52	Nello	no problem :)
2019-11-04 13:52:09	coldragon	In a ParallaxBackground i can't access it ? :/
2019-11-04 13:53:17	Nello	it's only accessible to nodes that inherit from CanvasItem
2019-11-04 13:53:42	Nello	so anything under Node2D or Control
2019-11-04 13:54:44	Nello	so if the node you have doesn't inherit from CanvasItem you can either a) grab the size from a node that does inherit from CanvasItem and pass it along or b) add a CanvasItem as a child in your scene and get it that way
2019-11-04 13:58:55	coldragon	Ok thank's. It's weird that ParallaxBackground aren't one
2019-11-04 13:59:14	coldragon	I think it's some sort of controller node and the ParallaxBackgroundLayer are derived from Node2D
2019-11-04 13:59:43	Nello	yeah parallaxbackground is part of canvaslayer not canvasitem
2019-11-04 14:00:06	coldragon	Ok thank's
2019-11-04 14:00:10	ibenx	Someone please help me https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/33328 thanks..
2019-11-04 14:00:35	Nello	but the parallaxlayers you use with parallaxbackground do inherit from canvasitem coldragon
2019-11-04 14:00:42	Nello	so you can grab it from there if you're using that
2019-11-04 14:04:43	coldragon	Yes I looked it in the doc
2019-11-04 14:04:48	coldragon	I understand their diff now
2019-11-04 14:04:52	coldragon	thank's a lot :)
2019-11-04 14:05:01	coldragon	Everything work like I expected !
2019-11-04 14:09:28	Nello	good to hear!

2019-11-05 11:07:46	code-xd	Thanks
2019-11-05 11:07:52	Keetz	code-xd: that is a great place to start :)
2019-11-05 11:08:09	code-xd	Have you been contributing?
2019-11-05 11:08:19	Keetz	A little bit
2019-11-05 11:08:28	code-xd	So how did you start?
2019-11-05 11:08:47	code-xd	Like what are the resources for getting familiar with codebase
2019-11-05 11:09:07	Keetz	code-xd: by running into a bug that i couldn't live with, so I started to look into it myself and eventually fix it
2019-11-05 11:09:40	code-xd	So in which os are you working?
2019-11-05 11:09:44	code-xd	Windows or Linux
2019-11-05 11:09:52	Keetz	Linux
2019-11-05 11:10:03	code-xd	Does Godot work in Linux?
2019-11-05 11:10:08	Keetz	Very well
2019-11-05 11:10:13	code-xd	So how you debug after building?
2019-11-05 11:10:25	Keetz	I will be heading to lunch now, ask away and i will answer what i can when back :)
2019-11-05 11:10:45	code-xd	Yeahhhh sure really appreciate your help

2019-11-05 11:12:36	code-xd	So i had few doubts
2019-11-05 11:12:36	code-xd	One is that what issues to start from when working in GitHub.
2019-11-05 11:12:36	code-xd	Second I know C++ and STL what more should I learn to get familiar with the Godot environment?
2019-11-05 11:12:36	code-xd	Third question is that how do I debug after building the software?

2019-11-05 11:44:00	code-xd	Thanks alot I will asking doubts now and then. I want to get into open source developement and Godot interests me alot because one time I used to use unity game engine
2019-11-05 11:45:13	Keetz	code-xd: also if you stumble upon more engine specific stuff, you might want to head over to #godotengine-devel
2019-11-05 11:45:31	Keetz	And if you have questions about how to fix/implement something specific, that is the place to ask
2019-11-05 11:46:08	code-xd	Thanks alot
2019-11-05 11:46:26	code-xd	How much time did it take for you to get familiar with the codebase?
2019-11-05 11:48:41	Keetz	code-xd: I am not at all familiar with the codebase :D I dived into very specific parts of the code to fix/implement something, and the scope have always been pretty small

2019-11-05 11:54:53	Keetz	I wouldn't say i know :)
2019-11-05 11:55:41	Keetz	Sometimes i get by by searching for something specific. The only thing i know is that every related to nodes is in "/scene"

2019-11-08 10:20:01	alexandre9099	hi, i'm trying to setup an array with dialogs (and other metadata about them) like this https://epad.alexandrebadalo.pt/p/r.4fa9dda2059805c73b18fbf9e89d4672 but it seems like i'm doing everything wrong ;) can anyone give me a hint on how to procced?
2019-11-08 10:35:43	Nello	alexandre9099, i think either of this depending on what you want https://hastebin.com/daviwobilu.cs
2019-11-08 10:36:58	alexandre9099	what would be the difference between the first and the second?
2019-11-08 10:37:08	Nello	oops i screwed up the second one
2019-11-08 10:37:16	Nello	i'll paste a new one and explain the difference
2019-11-08 10:38:14	Nello	https://hastebin.com/budofivuru.cs in the first one you'd access the first dialog with dialogs["suzane"]["dialogs"][0]
2019-11-08 10:38:36	Nello	in the second it'd be dialogs["suzane"]["dialogs"]["first"]
2019-11-08 10:38:59	alexandre9099	i see, thanks a lot ;) the first one is what i want
2019-11-08 10:39:55	alexandre9099	though the first one the editor complains about a ":" missing
2019-11-08 10:40:20	alexandre9099	on line 7 from your file
2019-11-08 10:42:21	Nello	oh sorry i only fixed the one line there were some extra brackets
2019-11-08 10:42:24	Nello	let me reformat it
2019-11-08 10:44:31	Nello	alexandre9099, https://hastebin.com/madewetoxu.cs sorry took me a second i'm not used to formatting this way

2019-11-08 16:52:08	Nello	Calinou, cool thanks changing my code over to that helped readability
2019-11-08 16:52:11	Nello	hey jimbzy!
2019-11-08 16:52:30	jimbzy	What up Nello
2019-11-08 16:53:27	Nello	i upscaled my game to 1080p and it was crashing because of call_deferred shenanigans so i stepped through it with the debugger and now it's working fine
2019-11-08 16:53:38	Nello	i'm afraid my game is turning into a buggy bomb waiting to go off
2019-11-08 16:54:10	Technipion	Nello: oh oh that sounds like you have race conditions
2019-11-08 16:54:45	Nello	Technipion, that's what i thought but why did i stop! it crashed 10x in a row then when i debugged it it started working fine
2019-11-08 16:55:02	Nello	i rebooted everything too cause i was paranoid it was cached somehow
2019-11-08 16:55:27	Nello	why did it stop*
2019-11-08 16:55:30	Technipion	Nello: That's how race conditions behave - unforeseeable. That's why debugging multithreaded applications is such a pain in the a**
2019-11-08 16:56:02	Nello	well i'll change it to 720p and see what happens i'm gonna figure this out
2019-11-08 16:56:40	Technipion	Nello: It's best to step through your code again and check whether you are doing something not thread-safe
2019-11-08 16:57:48	Nello	when i was trying to troubleshoot it i thought it might be trying to add_child(node) then immediately var = $node
2019-11-08 16:58:05	Nello	but i didn't think that would do it
2019-11-08 16:58:19	Nello	it's not like queue_free or call_deferred there shouldn't be a delay with add_child right?
2019-11-08 16:59:02	Technipion	https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/tutorials/threads/thread_safe_apis.html#scene-tree
2019-11-08 16:59:24	Nello	haha
2019-11-08 16:59:35	Nello	i did not get to that section yet
2019-11-08 16:59:40	Nello	thank you :D
2019-11-08 17:00:18	Technipion	Nello: Yeah sometimes you have to do cross-reading in the docs. It is what it is. Game development is complicated
2019-11-08 17:00:21	Nello	i like that add_child is the example too that's perfect
2019-11-08 17:00:35	jaggz	any of you get a google play payments thing working?
2019-11-08 17:01:04	jaggz	how about google play login?
2019-11-08 17:02:46	Nello	jaggz, https://www.summonage.com/en/ is made with godot i saw the dev in the comments of an issue on github so it should work
2019-11-08 17:02:50	Nello	but i haven't tried yet

2019-11-12 11:14:14	ycjung	Einlander: Sticking on a moving platform is out of the laws of physics: you might want to consider updating its position directly. Otherwise, if you use physical attribute to indirectly implement the platform, you'll sometimes observe objects falling of the platform.

2019-11-12 12:14:23	azagaya	It works while running the game from the editor.. but it doesnt on exported version... soundArray becomes empty, or with size 0
2019-11-12 12:14:45	azagaya	Is there anything to have into account when using dir_content on an exported game?
2019-11-12 12:23:48	Cheeseness	azagaya: Are those files loose with the exported game, or are they packed inside the pck file?
2019-11-12 12:24:24	azagaya	They are packed
2019-11-12 12:24:29	azagaya	should they be loose?
2019-11-12 12:24:36	Cheeseness	Yeah, packed files can't be accessed with dir_contents() IIRC
2019-11-12 12:25:45	Cheeseness	Actually, what path are you giving it? Maybe it respects a res:// URI?
2019-11-12 12:26:20	azagaya	Cheeseness: yes, it respects that
2019-11-12 12:26:51	azagaya	and how could i achieve something like the snippet above that works ingame? i want to reproduce random sounds from a path
2019-11-12 12:26:55	Cheeseness	Yeah, so that's the only way to access packed files AFIK. They don't exist in the normal filesystem anymore
2019-11-12 12:27:42	azagaya	the path is res://Sounds/Steps... now that i think, it makes sense that i'm not able to use dir_contents for packed resources
2019-11-12 12:29:22	azagaya	Cheeseness: i didn't understand.. how can i access that files without giving the full path? i want to reproduce random sounds.
2019-11-12 12:29:53	Cheeseness	Assuming dir_content is a copy of what's in this documentation page, then just pass res://Sound/Steps in and don't change anything else
2019-11-12 12:30:22	Cheeseness	https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/classes/class_directory.html
2019-11-12 12:33:44	azagaya	But i'm doing that.
2019-11-12 12:33:51	azagaya	It works only on editor... let me check
2019-11-12 12:34:14	Cheeseness	You didn't have a "res://" URI in the code you shared that I could see
2019-11-12 12:35:35	azagaya	path variable has that format... if i print that it returns this: res://Sounds/HeroSteps
2019-11-12 12:36:44	azagaya	`dir_contents()` is always opening `soundPath`

2019-11-12 12:38:52	azagaya	res://Sounds/HeroSteps
2019-11-12 12:39:32	azagaya	i pass that to the `start(path)` function i passed above.. i print the variable and get that path ingame

2019-11-12 12:45:47	azagaya	Oh great! thanks a lot! I'll try after work and i'll tell you
2019-11-12 12:47:05	Cheeseness	But it's pretty much just calling Directory.open() with a res:// URI, which is what you said you're already doing. Maybe it needs a trailing slash or something (I wouldn't think so though)
2019-11-12 12:47:42	azagaya	yeah, i'm doing it... I see in the console the correct path being printed.
2019-11-12 12:48:32	azagaya	the only difference i notice is that you use `end_with` instead of `get_extension` to see the extension
2019-11-12 12:50:39	azagaya	Ohh i found the issue i think... only import files are listed when run ingame... i forgot to export something?
2019-11-12 12:51:57	Cheeseness	Ah yes, if your scripts aren't referencing things, they don't get included by default
2019-11-12 12:52:22	azagaya	I only see this: `[step_0.wav.import, step_1.wav.import, step_10.wav.import <etc>]` when run in game, and this: `[step_8.wav.import, step_9.wav.import, step_1.wav, step_6.wav <etc>]` from editor
2019-11-12 12:52:34	Cheeseness	I have *.ogg  in my list of "Filters to export non-resource files" in my project export configuration
2019-11-12 12:53:12	azagaya	Cheeseness: Ohhh thats the problem
2019-11-12 12:53:23	azagaya	so i should look in the export dialog to include them
2019-11-12 12:53:57	Cheeseness	Yeah, sorry. I'd completely forgotten about that
2019-11-12 12:55:01	Cheeseness	By default, Godot only packs in files that are referenced explicitly by scripts (so stuff that's dynamically loaded like this doesn't get added)

2019-11-13 14:16:58	azagaya	bojidar_bg: I think i found something starge. Monsters have layer 3 of collissions, and mask 1, so they collide with walls but not between each other.
2019-11-13 14:17:42	azagaya	If i enable also mask 3 so they collide each other, it works better and profiler doesn't give me such hight physics process results
2019-11-13 14:19:46	bojidar_bg	I think there was an issue related to this, not sure though
2019-11-13 14:20:12	bojidar_bg	I feel that layers and masks were tested after calculating the collision point, and that might be the cause of the problem
2019-11-13 14:20:22	bojidar_bg	what shapes do the monsters have?
2019-11-13 14:21:00	azagaya	circle shapes some, rectangle shapes other
2019-11-13 14:22:05	azagaya	bojidar_bg: but although the point is calculated before layers and mask, it should be at least the same, shouldnt it? I mean, why making they collide works better?
2019-11-13 14:22:16	azagaya	Ahhh, because there are not that much mosnters in the same place

2019-11-13 14:22:31	bojidar_bg	since calculating that point is slower when there is a collision
2019-11-13 14:22:52	bojidar_bg	try with all-circles, if it is faster, that might confirm the theory :D
2019-11-13 14:26:03	azagaya	ok
2019-11-13 14:26:23	azagaya	So i let disabled the mask 3 and change every collision of mosnters to cirlces
2019-11-13 14:28:41	azagaya	Well, i left only monsters with circle collision shapes, and the game stills slows down.. idk if more or less than before
2019-11-13 14:31:59	azagaya	bojidar_bg: Yes, it slows down, but deffinitly works better with circles
2019-11-13 14:32:11	azagaya	So is there a work arround?
2019-11-13 14:32:30	bojidar_bg	Area2D without monitorable might be faster, I think
2019-11-13 14:32:48	azagaya	Instead of using kinematics?
2019-11-13 14:33:06	azagaya	bojidar_bg: but i need monsters to collide with walls
2019-11-13 14:33:16	bojidar_bg	what are the walls like?

2019-11-13 14:35:23	azagaya	Columns have polygon2d shape (i assume even slower than squares?) and walls are tilemaps with sqare collision shapes
2019-11-13 14:35:33	bojidar_bg	ah, I was thinking it was a shump -- would have been much easier in that case
2019-11-13 14:35:55	EvilCorp	why does mono godot 64 gets stuck at 20% when trying to search for templates
2019-11-13 14:35:59	azagaya	whats a shump?

2019-11-13 14:37:06	azagaya	more like a hack & slash i think
2019-11-13 14:37:41	bojidar_bg	azagaya: Can you live with the slowdown or with colliding enemies for now, while opening/commenting on an issue? I could look into the physics engine later, and maybe cook something fix up for 4.0/3.2.1/3.3
2019-11-13 14:38:14	jimbzy	How's your collision detection code work, azagaya?
2019-11-13 14:38:21	azagaya	Yeah, its just a game for a jam, so its not much problem
2019-11-13 14:39:11	azagaya	jimbzy: i'm not using code for that, i just selected the layers and masks and let the engine make its magic
2019-11-13 14:39:48	jimbzy	That's wild because I've had dozens of objects going and didn't experience any slowdowns.
2019-11-13 14:40:34	azagaya	bojidar_bg: I'll open an issue, let me prepare a minimal project to reproduce it after work. I would like to help in something to the fix if i can.. would you tell me if its not to complicated for a noob like me? Physics always are complicated
2019-11-13 14:41:17	bojidar_bg	depends, have to check the code and maybe even a profiling trace to say how simple the fix would be ^
2019-11-13 14:41:31	bojidar_bg	EvilCorp: does it happen only with the mono version?
2019-11-13 14:42:57	azagaya	jimbzy: i'm using 3.2 alpha, and also, many bodies overlap, as they dont collide between each others.
2019-11-13 14:43:39	azagaya	If i make them collide between each other, it works much better, perhaps because bodies do not overlap, and less collissions are calculated
2019-11-13 14:43:46	jimbzy	Ahhh I gotcha.  Yeah I'm using 3.2 also, but most of mine are straight up collisions.

2019-11-13 14:45:37	jimbzy	That's pretty strange.  I'll keep my eyes open for similar problems.

2019-11-13 14:46:33	jimbzy	I only use physics bodies for collisions, though I do pass them through Area2D's from time to time for effects.
