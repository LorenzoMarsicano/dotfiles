2019-09-13 17:51:03	fogine	Hello guys,I'm developing sort of drawing tool and I'm using CanvasItem draw_texture() to draw with "brush". Now I need to rotate the bursh texture. This can be done by draw_set_transform(position, rotation, scale) method.The issue I'm having is that I need to rotate around texture center, not around default global origin which is Vector2.ZEROI
2019-09-13 17:51:03	fogine	tried something like this:func _draw():        draw_set_transform(offset, brush_options.rotation, Vector2.ONE) //where offset is Vector2 offset from (0,0) to center of texture        draw_texture(brush_texture, brush_options.position) // where position is local position of left-top corner of the brush locationThe idea was that by setting transform
2019-09-13 17:51:04	fogine	position to offset vector, the texture will be shifted before its rotated, however this doesnt seem to be correct thinking...Could somebody help please?
