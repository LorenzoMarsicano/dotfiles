2019-09-13 17:51:03	fogine	Hello guys,I'm developing sort of drawing tool and I'm using CanvasItem draw_texture() to draw with "brush". Now I need to rotate the bursh texture. This can be done by draw_set_transform(position, rotation, scale) method.The issue I'm having is that I need to rotate around texture center, not around default global origin which is Vector2.ZEROI
2019-09-13 17:51:03	fogine	tried something like this:func _draw():        draw_set_transform(offset, brush_options.rotation, Vector2.ONE) //where offset is Vector2 offset from (0,0) to center of texture        draw_texture(brush_texture, brush_options.position) // where position is local position of left-top corner of the brush locationThe idea was that by setting transform
2019-09-13 17:51:04	fogine	position to offset vector, the texture will be shifted before its rotated, however this doesnt seem to be correct thinking...Could somebody help please?

2019-10-17 17:27:25	jimbzy	My older brother is a heavy mechanic and he built a machine just for stopping runaways.  It uses a CO2 tank with a solenoid valve that's operated by a tachometer.  If an engine goes above the set RPM's it automatically releases the CO2 directly into the intake and chokes the engine out.

2019-10-18 10:08:42	Calinou	vrav: there's itos() and rtos() to convert integers and reals (floats) to strings in Godot, not sure if you can use that in GDNative
2019-10-18 10:09:12	Calinou	in Godot's codebase, you could do print_line(rtos(vec2.x))
2019-10-18 10:10:56	houkime	vrav at least in C API tutorial there is a section about making an actual godot "variant" from string https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/blob/2f9ffbb5513925ebf30a222d9e9c0aa790f57f55/tutorials/plugins/gdnative/gdnative-c-example.rst
2019-10-18 10:12:12	houkime	Calinou, as i understand (maybe incorrect) GDNative is not really the same as using  C++ from the codebase.

2019-10-18 10:18:46	houkime	As i understood the thing is to interface your own functions and possibly 3rd party libraries with a special limited API which kind of wraps your functions in a gdscript-like form. So you can't really use C++/C classes directly in output but need to translate everything into things gdscript can see.

2019-10-18 10:24:03	houkime	and the same goes for inputs, including the fact that you're given a limited set of engine function pointers that you're allowed to call, i presume your abilities are limited to be the same as those of gdscript.

2019-10-18 10:31:06	houkime	So, in this example as I (probably incorectly) may suggest, what happens is that vec2 is a Godot class that prints normally because it was taken care of by a special c ++ wrapper.
2019-10-18 10:31:28	houkime	but std::string on the other hand is a raw C++ class
2019-10-18 10:32:48	houkime	so trying to Godot::print it might not work.
2019-10-18 10:33:39	houkime	vec2.x might also happen to be a raw c++ float
2019-10-18 10:34:39	houkime	If that's the case, the problem is in the implementation of Godot::print that lacks needed polymorphism.
2019-10-18 10:35:41	Calinou	GDScript doesn't have polymorphism, that might hinder it
2019-10-18 10:35:49	Calinou	unless there's a way to fix it only in the C++ bindings

2019-10-18 10:43:49	houkime	print that is in raw C API cannot print standard C things and needs variants to be explicitly constructed by the programmer. So if there are implicit conversions going on and failing they are probably in c++ bindings.
2019-10-18 10:47:14	houkime	or i am terribly misunderstanding something... which is quite possible.
