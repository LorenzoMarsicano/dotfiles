2019-07-15 16:41:18	slapin	I need to set up CI and not bother with windows too much at this stage

2019-07-16 11:05:31	Technipion	Is there maybe something like a "panel" node that can embed 2D controls into 3D space?
2019-07-16 11:07:15	Keetz	Technipion: well no. Control nodes are only 2D and meant for UI, with that said they will be drawn when running your 3D scene, so you could calculate some positions and just place the control nodes where you want them
2019-07-16 11:07:58	Keetz	Maybe even just place them under your Spatial node?

2019-07-16 11:13:24	Technipion	Keetz: That would also allow me to customize the look of the bar...
2019-07-16 11:13:58	Keetz	Technipion: yea that could work too. Have a background sprite that is just static, and then have a 1x1 sprite that you can just scale to fit
