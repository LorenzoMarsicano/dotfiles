2019-09-13 09:07:58	Tom^45	pepijndevos because it means you wouldnt notice the errors like https://www.archlinux.org/news/ that requires manual intervention or all the .pacnews/.pacsaves etc

2019-09-13 09:10:16	pepijndevos	Tom^45, It still prompts you if you want to install it. I don't see how with a good UX it'd be any different from running a shell command.
2019-09-13 09:10:52	pepijndevos	And it's not just about updates, but also about being able to browse packages in the gui

2019-09-13 09:11:33	Tom^45	browser packages or install them with a gui is a different thing, and there are various GUI "package managers" that does so but autoupdating is something i wouldnt recommend doing

AFAIK it doesn't hurt to update the kernel without rebooting as long as the old modules still exist, and most other distros handle it just fine

2019-09-13 12:05:14	mort	I'm thinking maybe it'd be nicer to just make the pacman hook do everything and not have a startup script; the hook would first check for old modules directories and delete them, then back up the current directory, run the upgrade, then move the backed up directory back

2019-09-13 14:25:39	Strykar	yea, I know, I've been unable to install it myself because it wants older PHP and ICU versions
2019-09-13 14:26:00	mpan	Strykar: in any case: you may have multiple PHP versions in Apache. So there is no need to downgrade the php package. Just build an older version to “/usr/local” and configure Apache according to one of a myriad guides on the web.
2019-09-13 14:26:17	mpan	(dunno about nginx, but since it’s a reverse proxy, there must be a way to do the same in it)
2019-09-13 14:27:13	mpan	Keep in mind that most likely you will like to have separate ini for the other version.

2019-09-13 15:29:26	tty1	Is there an easy way to make it so at boot time i can select between a nvidia based driver or the neaveau driver? The nvidia one is the only one that works with OpenCL, but it also wont work with any WM other than KDE apparently. The neaveau one doesnt seem to support OpenCL but it does allow all the WM to work...

2019-09-13 16:26:22	shaarad	should I just touch vconsole.conf
2019-09-13 16:26:27	ayekat	probably mkinitcpio was changed to print an additional warning at the end if it encountered errors half waythrough

2019-09-13 16:28:45	ayekat	so you could ignore it - but it's probably cleaner to write a vconsole.conf

2019-10-17 11:58:30	jamespharvey20	as long as the memtest passes at last overnight, maybe even longer, you'll probably need to file bugreport upstream, possibly ask in #mozilla, and possibly compile a debug version of firefox to give a backtrace with symbols.  i could be wrong, but i don't think this'll be easy for them to fix without quite a bit of involvement from you.

2019-10-17 16:45:00	kerframil	demonicmaniac3: indeed. that was the other concern.
2019-10-17 16:45:22	kerframil	demonicmaniac3: having predictable resource usage for a single instance, that is.
2019-10-17 16:45:45	kerframil	I'd give it another shake if I had images large enough for it to plausibly pay off.
2019-10-17 16:45:51	mpan	A side note: imagemagic is also known for performing many operations in a very inefficient manner. E.g. mean over many images is calculated by first loading them all in memory and then calculating mean. So you may hog your memory with imagemagick even if you do not see the obvious reason for that.

2019-10-17 16:53:37	demonicmaniac3	plus don't underestimate the overhead of launching imagemagick each time
2019-10-17 16:53:56	kerframil	yeah. although, perl is pretty fast at forking.
2019-10-17 16:53:59	ulteq	I think that overhead might be the main reason why it is so slow

2019-10-17 16:54:28	kerframil	I highly doubt that parallel is responsible for the overhead. I can smash it here with bash, and bash is way slower than perl.

2019-10-22 14:44:54	algorythmis_	yeah but even if i put the right SSID in NetworkManager it won't connect
2019-10-22 14:45:04	b1tninja	you can use network manager to set it up
2019-10-22 14:45:18	b1tninja	you want a failover bond wifi and ethernet
2019-10-22 14:45:26	algorythmis_	and the SSID shouldn't be hidden since i can connect to it from my phone

2019-10-22 16:29:19	troulouliou_div2	hi i m reading the wiki to get a full encrypted disk with grub . However upon the wiki only lvm1 scheme is suported and /boot folder has to be in inside root partition. Is there a way to have a separate /boot in this schenario ?

2019-10-22 16:32:57	grazzolini	troulouliou_div2: bottom line is, if you want your boot also encrypted, either you use everything luks1 or you have a separate partition for boot with luks1 and root with luks2
2019-10-22 16:33:10	grazzolini	troulouliou_div2: they wouldn't change
2019-10-22 16:33:21	grazzolini	troulouliou_div2: you enable cryptodisk support on grub itself

2019-10-22 16:34:05	troulouliou_div2	grazzolini, im confugsed :) how will grub find the encrypted /boot luks v1 partition ?

2019-10-23 11:34:40	iron_houzi	*were
2019-10-23 11:34:54	th0rne	Basically, I just use "aura -As" to search, "aura -Ax" to install, and "aura -Akux" to update. For the rest you can just use pacman. I'd say it's good, but suit yourself.

I'm not sure how to interpret the "appear" ("force a refresh of all package databases, even if they appear to be up-to-date") in pacman man page. Is there any reason to worry if one only ever uses single -y, or is double -y really only meant when you need to force-download the databases, e.g. you know they're corrupted or something?

2019-10-23 12:08:52	horseface	it should bring those values back because i have got 'resume=/dev/mapper/cryptroot' in my kernel parameters... any idea why? when the '/sys/power/resume' file holds the values '0:0' hibernate does not work, but if i manually change the values to '254:0' then hibernate works...

2019-10-23 12:55:52	b1tninja	yea ignore what I said about that
2019-10-23 12:55:57	b1tninja	its just that you updated pacman
2019-10-23 12:56:04	b1tninja	and yay was looking for the old shared library
2019-10-23 12:56:08	b1tninja	now yay needs to be updated
2019-10-23 12:56:16	ttmx	Uh
2019-10-23 12:56:22	ttmx	How would I do so?

2019-10-23 12:56:45	b1tninja	ive never used yay, but how did you install it
2019-10-23 12:57:05	b1tninja	you can just extract the old shared library out of the old pacman pkp from the cache, but it is probably a really bad idea
2019-10-23 12:57:16	amcrae	...
2019-10-23 12:57:24	amcrae	no probably about it!

2019-10-23 12:57:38	b1tninja	my guess is yay has a PKGBUILD in aur
2019-10-23 12:57:43	b1tninja	you would use makepkg to build that

2019-10-23 13:05:35	b1tninja	users are permitted to pick people they trust

2019-10-24 11:35:04	Foxboron	LogicAside: locally hosted DNS resolvers will be visible for the ISP.
2019-10-24 11:35:04	ekollof	at least you have control of those machines
2019-10-24 11:35:13	Foxboron	DNS is unencrypted, that is why you add encryption.

However, when I plug and unplug any headphones, the speaker's audio quality becomes really bad. I don't know enough English vocabulary to describe it, but it's similar to how a radio station would sound if played with a bad signal. Could someone help me troubleshoot the problem?

I have a gtx 1070 and if i install the proprietary drivers (tried nvidia, and nvidia-dkms) then I get a black screen. I also tried using nouveau but that only results in me getting as far as getting the message "reached target graphical interface" and then nothing happens. Any clue what's goign on?

2019-10-25 17:36:52	rendysurvage	ok. So firefox is complaining that the wiki requires https. Says it's a security issue

2019-10-25 17:39:13	sillyKitty	So I'm running startx to start i3 on a desktop with multiple monitors attached. I have a script (generated from arandr) that sets up the monitors the way they should be oriented and resolution. Problem is I'm not exactly sure where to put the exec or ./ command to have it run after i3/x has started
2019-10-25 17:39:32	rcf	sillyKitty: after i3? In the i3 configuration.

2019-10-25 17:40:16	MacGyver	Just don't *exec* it.
2019-10-25 17:40:17	sillyKitty	hmm. this was my first throught but I thought maybe there was someplace better. wouldn't it try to run again if I reload the i3 config and it is in there
2019-10-25 17:40:34	sillyKitty	ah, oh, fork it to the background in xinitrc, thats what I was missing

2019-10-25 17:40:50	earnestly	No

2019-10-28 14:39:30	MacGyver	Because as has been pointed out, our kernels don't have those modules compiled in.

2019-10-28 14:44:34	earnestly	Because /something/ will have to unbind them if they're already bound by another module/driver

2019-10-28 14:44:46	MacGyver	It is. Really, the only reason we still bind GPUs to vfio-pci is all the behaviour of automatically opening handles on them, and GPU drivers being insane in general.
2019-10-28 14:44:56	MacGyver	But most other hardware handles unbinds just fine.

2019-10-29 12:00:39	TobTobXX	Hi, yesterday evening my ThinkPad T400 crashed because the battery dropped to 0% and today morning I get Kernel panics when I try to boot it. Maybe it is because I didnt cleanly shut it down after kernel update (5.3.6->5.3.7 IIRC). I do have a KDE Neon (so Ubuntu based) Live USB at my disposal for troubleshooting. How do I start fixing my Arch installation? I have already fsck'd all partitions, they're fine.
2019-10-29 12:00:39	TobTobXX	Kernel Panic logs are difficult to get, since it outputs so much I can only see the bottom. Thanks!

2019-10-29 12:45:05	fishguts	Remarkable! After staring at the GTK filechooser source for a while and struggling to determine how I might facilitate a maximum size for the filechooser, I realised I could implement it in Xmonad instead. Now the filepicker is a sensible size! Not sure what changed in xmonad, GTK or Chrome in the last few months to make the filepicker larger than my resolution by default, but I'm glad it's fixed.
2019-10-29 12:45:38	fishguts	If anyone else comes across a similar issue, you can fix it in xmonad by targeting Role "GtkFileChooserDialog" with something like doRectFloat (W.RationalRect 0.10 0.10 0.80 0.80)

2019-10-29 15:29:05	jshap	could i file a bug to request a package be split? like cuda -> cuda & cuda-samples
2019-10-29 15:29:25	jshap	or is that outside the scope of a bug
2019-10-29 15:29:41	Namarrgon	you can file "feature requests"
2019-10-29 15:29:45	Foxboron	why would you want cude and cuda-samples split?
2019-10-29 15:30:08	Foxboron	Rule of thumb: we don't split packages unless there is some overwhelming reason why we should do so.
2019-10-29 15:30:22	jshap	because cuda-samples is optional normally, the .run installer asks if you want it optionally
2019-10-29 15:30:30	jshap	main reason would be size, i guess

2019-10-29 17:20:42	akadius	Hi, I'm trying to get mainline-linux, I installed it manualy and through yay but I cannot boot into it. I use efibootmgr, do I need to create a new entry just for mainline-linux ?

2019-10-30 11:19:57	triplc	I am running pacman -Syyu but it ask me that /var/cache/pacman/pkg/pkgconf-1.6.3-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)).
2019-10-30 11:20:00	Namarrgon	whatever the problem is, resetting the pacman db is not a solution

Basically my speakers keep turning off and on audibly as audio either gets low or stops then starts again. I have currently masked .socket and .service as user in systemctl and `pulseaudio --start` but haven't played with the config as I'm not sure what addresses this

2019-10-31 10:45:18	DrRetro	Good morning and friendly greetings to all! I have the following problem with a Thinkpad X230, which is equipped with a Coreboot BIOS: After the update to kernel 5.3.7.arch1-2 the WLAN chipset only worked sporadically, some acpi-calls were not performed correctly and a SHUTDOWN or a REBOOT were just not clean anymore. It got stuck with crude error messages sometime. (example: sd-unmoun[XXX] failed to unmount '/oldroot') A downgrade to the kernel
2019-10-31 10:45:18	DrRetro	 5.3.7.arch1-1 helped to fix the problems with the ACPI calls, WIFI, SHUTDOWN and REBOOT. I also downloaded the appropriate linux headers from the archive and downgraded them accordingly.  However, installed modules like WIREGUARD don't end up in the appropriate path. If I install the wireguard-arch package with 'pacman -S wireguard-arch' and then run a 'modprobe wireguard' I get the error message: modprobe: FATAL: Module wireguard not found in
2019-10-31 10:45:18	DrRetro	directory /lib/modules/5.3.7-arch1-1-ARCH. Does any of you know the easiest way to fix this?
2019-10-31 10:45:20	smalltalk	do you guys know if fedora remove it from their official repo too?
2019-10-31 10:45:30	smalltalk	*removed

Is it neccessary to upgrade the bios before I switch my BIOS/MBR setup to an UEFI one ? And if so, do I have to reinstall windumb to do that ?

2019-10-31 14:01:26	Franciman	what if I first zero the whole disk?
2019-10-31 14:01:37	Franciman	dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb
2019-10-31 14:01:40	grawity	as far as the computer knows, the sectors contain exactly what you just wrote into them
2019-10-31 14:01:52	demonicmaniac3	that's pointless for a usb stick really
2019-10-31 14:02:11	grawity	so whether you zero it or not doesn't matter much, after writing an ISO it'll just boot into that ISO, it won't have any previous files left anymore
2019-10-31 14:02:36	grawity	(it'll have some leftover data *beyond* the ISO -- as the ISO is smaller than the USB stick -- but the OS won't be looking at that data since there's no partition at that location)
2019-10-31 14:02:52	demonicmaniac3	grawity: i've had odd sticks that didn't let you overwrite the first 2mb of the stick before the actual first partition starts and you couldn't dd to just the stick

2019-10-31 17:15:56	thursdaylark	as much as it added complexity to the user setup, the current way is much more archian imo

2019-11-04 16:22:59	superherointj	Biganon, "network" is the concept of a group of computers/devices that comunicates (with each other) (very broad, very general).

2019-11-05 11:24:59	stormsz	whats the most lightweight networkmanager alternative that will only be used on 1 network, the same one, it will never change....literally i just want to have internet but i dont want network manager...its taking 7sec for waitonline, 6 for the service, theres also wpa_supplicant 3sec. was thinking of systemd-network...what do you guys think?

2019-11-05 11:29:01	stormsz	hm ok! so my plan right now is: try systemd-networkd with iwd backend! thanks boys
2019-11-05 11:29:23	grawity	networkd does not have backends as such
2019-11-05 11:29:32	grawity	I guess you can use it with e.g. wpa_supplicant or iwd
2019-11-05 11:29:32	bertptrs	stormsz: you can also use iwd on its own, without networkd. You can try that too
2019-11-05 11:29:41	grawity	but if you use iwd, then it *really* wants to configure IP addresses all on its own anyway
2019-11-05 11:29:49	grawity	so in that case just use iwd alone
2019-11-05 11:31:05	stormsz	i just want the fastest honestly. will try both, one at the time then

2019-11-05 14:12:02	strongestAvenger	hi @grawity - disabled most of my internal usb host components and after a few reboots the issue still persists. I reckon it's some kind of intel security module that I'm not using
2019-11-05 14:12:22	Namarrgon	is this on a desktop or laptop?
2019-11-05 14:12:31	grawity	is it just one message on boot, or does it just keep spamming you later?

2019-11-05 14:15:03	grawity	then ignore it, you probably can't get rid of it unless you determine what device it is
2019-11-05 14:15:08	grawity	doubt it's a security module though

2019-11-06 16:13:27	Erayaydin	I think, a signature shouldn't be VCS, so I will ignore it :)

2019-11-06 16:14:11	eschwartz	Also, I don't know why you think a signature should not be VCS.
2019-11-06 16:14:11	Erayaydin	no, they didn't :)

2019-11-06 16:14:46	eschwartz	Is there some moral law about not checking signatures into VCS? Where else would you put it -- is there a relevant ftp server.
2019-11-06 16:15:05	eschwartz	I don't know what a composer global update is.
2019-11-06 16:15:08	Erayaydin	eschwartz: I think, its composer's self installer signature, which retrieve with API :)
2019-11-06 16:15:25	Erayaydin	let me share website; https://composer.github.io/pubkeys.html

2019-11-06 16:16:27	Erayaydin	PS: Its 'dotfiles' repo, I think user can use another composer version
2019-11-06 16:16:28	eschwartz	wait, so you're saying it's a signature for the version of composer that was used during the latest development cycle of the project?
2019-11-06 16:16:51	Erayaydin	eschwartz: unfortunately, yes :(
2019-11-06 16:17:24	Erayaydin	I think, composer check downloaded file's stability with this signature
2019-11-06 16:17:26	eschwartz	is composer some tool that expects to be downloaded into $HOME/.composer/ and added to $PATH
2019-11-06 16:17:41	jelle	eschwartz: so why do you want it in dotfiles lol
2019-11-06 16:17:42	eschwartz	and then reinstalls itself in the background for extra wtf
2019-11-06 16:17:45	jelle	errr Erayaydin
2019-11-06 16:17:50	Erayaydin	eschwartz: yes for sub packages's binaries
2019-11-06 16:17:56	Erayaydin	jelle: for composer.json

2019-11-06 16:18:07	Erayaydin	jelle: so users can use dotfiles/composer/composer.json for retrieve composer plugins
2019-11-06 16:18:07	 *	jelle is confused
2019-11-06 16:18:17	eschwartz	Then my recommendation is to run as hard and fast away from the entire PHP programming language as you possibly can.
2019-11-06 16:18:41	jelle	yeah since PHP's langague is defined by composer
2019-11-06 16:18:45	Erayaydin	I do PHP web application with Laravel&Symfony as 'job'
2019-11-06 16:18:56	Erayaydin	since 9 years :P Its bad language but its okey for prototype
2019-11-06 16:19:04	jelle	Erayaydin: but you have a per project composer.json right?
2019-11-06 16:19:08	eschwartz	Mercy on your soul.

2019-11-06 16:19:28	eschwartz	Just don't manage composer via dotfiles?
2019-11-06 16:19:35	Erayaydin	jelle: or composer-version-check which extend composer's self
2019-11-06 16:19:58	jelle	Erayaydin: sure but what does that have to do with signatures, since you just store a .json file in git

2019-11-06 16:20:44	dexterlb	what's the easiest way to make X run as root? I'm debugging a difference between a Debian and Arch box, and wish to see if the fact that X runs as root under the debian install is what causes my problem
2019-11-06 16:21:03	dexterlb	in debian, running startx as user starts a X process as root
2019-11-06 16:21:16	jelle	wait, debian lives in the stone age??
