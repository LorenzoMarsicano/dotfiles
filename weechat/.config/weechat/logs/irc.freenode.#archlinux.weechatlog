2019-09-13 09:07:58	Tom^45	pepijndevos because it means you wouldnt notice the errors like https://www.archlinux.org/news/ that requires manual intervention or all the .pacnews/.pacsaves etc

2019-09-13 09:10:16	pepijndevos	Tom^45, It still prompts you if you want to install it. I don't see how with a good UX it'd be any different from running a shell command.
2019-09-13 09:10:52	pepijndevos	And it's not just about updates, but also about being able to browse packages in the gui

2019-09-13 09:11:33	Tom^45	browser packages or install them with a gui is a different thing, and there are various GUI "package managers" that does so but autoupdating is something i wouldnt recommend doing

AFAIK it doesn't hurt to update the kernel without rebooting as long as the old modules still exist, and most other distros handle it just fine

2019-09-13 12:05:14	mort	I'm thinking maybe it'd be nicer to just make the pacman hook do everything and not have a startup script; the hook would first check for old modules directories and delete them, then back up the current directory, run the upgrade, then move the backed up directory back

2019-09-13 14:25:39	Strykar	yea, I know, I've been unable to install it myself because it wants older PHP and ICU versions
2019-09-13 14:26:00	mpan	Strykar: in any case: you may have multiple PHP versions in Apache. So there is no need to downgrade the php package. Just build an older version to “/usr/local” and configure Apache according to one of a myriad guides on the web.
2019-09-13 14:26:17	mpan	(dunno about nginx, but since it’s a reverse proxy, there must be a way to do the same in it)
2019-09-13 14:27:13	mpan	Keep in mind that most likely you will like to have separate ini for the other version.

2019-09-13 15:29:26	tty1	Is there an easy way to make it so at boot time i can select between a nvidia based driver or the neaveau driver? The nvidia one is the only one that works with OpenCL, but it also wont work with any WM other than KDE apparently. The neaveau one doesnt seem to support OpenCL but it does allow all the WM to work...

2019-09-13 16:26:22	shaarad	should I just touch vconsole.conf
2019-09-13 16:26:27	ayekat	probably mkinitcpio was changed to print an additional warning at the end if it encountered errors half waythrough

2019-09-13 16:28:45	ayekat	so you could ignore it - but it's probably cleaner to write a vconsole.conf

2019-10-17 11:58:30	jamespharvey20	as long as the memtest passes at last overnight, maybe even longer, you'll probably need to file bugreport upstream, possibly ask in #mozilla, and possibly compile a debug version of firefox to give a backtrace with symbols.  i could be wrong, but i don't think this'll be easy for them to fix without quite a bit of involvement from you.

2019-10-17 16:45:00	kerframil	demonicmaniac3: indeed. that was the other concern.
2019-10-17 16:45:22	kerframil	demonicmaniac3: having predictable resource usage for a single instance, that is.
2019-10-17 16:45:45	kerframil	I'd give it another shake if I had images large enough for it to plausibly pay off.
2019-10-17 16:45:51	mpan	A side note: imagemagic is also known for performing many operations in a very inefficient manner. E.g. mean over many images is calculated by first loading them all in memory and then calculating mean. So you may hog your memory with imagemagick even if you do not see the obvious reason for that.

2019-10-17 16:53:37	demonicmaniac3	plus don't underestimate the overhead of launching imagemagick each time
2019-10-17 16:53:56	kerframil	yeah. although, perl is pretty fast at forking.
2019-10-17 16:53:59	ulteq	I think that overhead might be the main reason why it is so slow

2019-10-17 16:54:28	kerframil	I highly doubt that parallel is responsible for the overhead. I can smash it here with bash, and bash is way slower than perl.
