2019-07-01 12:21:24	float	Hello, i have a question. Is there something like OOM Killer, but for GUI environment? How you (some of you) deal with auto-kill applications? My workstation have only 4GB RAM, and most of time that's enough. My minimal work setup implies that there is running IDE (Jetbrains), some docker containers and slack. But most of time browser is running too. When i want to open some heavy (like GitKraken), my
2019-07-01 12:21:27	masterkorp	is this clonned-mac-address
2019-07-01 12:21:30	float	machine starts to run out of memory, and freezes until hard-reset. I have some swap, but it doesn't much help in that situations. I know there is OOM killer, but AFAIK, it fires only when kernel out of memory, which seems is not true in my situation (kernel feels good since it have enough memory). So i want to immediately kill some large application before that happens

2019-07-01 12:22:11	grawity	edit the profile belonging to the dock ethernet, put your normal MAC in that field, reconnect, done

2019-07-01 16:00:47	jnbrains	I'm trying to run zfs on root with the idea to understand better boot environments
2019-07-01 16:01:10	jnbrains	as bootloaders I'm using systemd-boot (bootctl)
2019-07-01 16:02:14	jnbrains	in the boot entry, when I set root=rpool/ROOT/default manually it boots without issue

2019-07-02 11:21:49	weystrom	i'll go check if i have it
2019-07-02 11:23:24	jonascj	weystrom: I haven't played with it personally, I once attempted something like what you link, wake up from suspend and then ahve a script hiberante, but I dispensed with hibernation all together, it was not needed for my daily work.
2019-07-02 11:23:59	jonascj	weystrom: I also suspect it requires certain hardware features, normally the resume from suspend is triggered by some hardware action (opening the lid, pressing the power button etc.)

2019-07-02 11:26:15	weystrom	i think it's pretty useful, covers a lot of usecases like "go to a meeting room - 10 mins of sleep - wake up from suspend" and "finished work for the day - close the lid - hibernate until morning"

2019-07-02 11:27:39	jonascj	weystrom: that was my initial usecase as well, but in the end the trouble of configuring it outweihed the benefits of having it. I'm configuring a new laptop in a few days though, it would be nice to have this feature. Also from an environmental point of view, saves energy.

2019-07-02 11:28:29	weystrom	not sure, systemd might leverage it in its scripts
2019-07-02 11:29:02	weystrom	luckily thinkpads are really good with linux, btw, was really easy to set up hibernation, even with luks-encrypted drive
2019-07-02 11:29:24	jonascj	of course, it has to use some of the same tecniques, I ws just referring to what you just tried. YOu tried systemd to suspend, which invokes rtcwake to suspend-then-wake, and upon waking it hibernates (maybe again jusing systemd)

2019-07-02 13:33:55	dreisner	amosbird: both potentially are. you won't get any interest from upstream kernel devs if your kernel is tainted due to OOT modules being loaded.
2019-07-02 13:34:02	dreisner	vboxdrv *especially* might be
2019-07-02 13:34:21	amosbird	ok
2019-07-02 13:34:23	dreisner	taint comes in a variety of flavors. a kernel dev once proposed a "crap" flag for taint specifically for vboxdrv because it's so bad.

What you describe reminds me of those events: processes randomly

2019-07-03 12:28:43	friendlyguy	i am wondering about strange things that parted does.... i am trying to create a partition right after the last partition: so i got that info (sector where the last partition ends) from parted, added 1 sector and said i wanted 34% of the freespace for the partition. however the calculation parted did is wrong

2019-07-03 14:15:52	quequotion	actually, for all the troubles I've had, I'm going to agree with e3ef13f4ff44 on this. arch *can be easy*, its users that make it hard.

I may if you think it's worthwhile but I figured it might be related to me not using overcommit.  There's apparently lots of bad software out there which don't handle allocation failures
2019-07-03 14:29:32	mpan	e3ef13f4ff44: but I would still do what I have said: check if it works in the older -lte and try to pinoint the bug. This way a group of just a few commits may be considered as the culprit, which will allow quick fix.

2019-07-04 10:07:50	amorris	When I switch to my Discord window, I get a white flicker before the Discord displays. This doesn't happen when I enable hardware acceleration on Discord, however if I enable it then Discord will sometimes randomly freeze and stop responding. Does anyone have any solution to get rid of either the white flicker or to stop Discord randomly freezing when I enable hardware acceleration? I'm using Discord from the AUR with BetterDiscord installed.

2019-07-04 13:47:28	raster	the only time i don't rely on a fs is if i'm making something very specific for usability - e.g. so something doesn't need installing. it's an archive file where all data can be random-accessed any time and it coems pre-compressed so user doesn't have to "unpack it" - just use it in-place. this makes sense because lots of entities are fairly small and it avoids block rounding up on the fs and avoids the need fo an installation step for

When I come to reboot my machine, I've to reinstall nvidia, reboot, then install nvidia-lts. I've got an NVIDIA Quadro NVS 810 which works fine in Ubuntu. If I start X without doing these steps, my entire system hangs and I'm forced to bruteforce it down.

2019-07-05 10:43:56	jonascj	Am I right in assuming that the output of `uname -m` would generally determine if youc an run 32bit or 64bit statically linked software? Like Processing: https://processing.org/download/
2019-07-05 10:43:58	@phrik	Title: Download \ Processing.org (at processing.org)
2019-07-05 10:45:28	jonascj	Of course some form of multilib support could allow 32bit software to run on 64bit kernel.
2019-07-05 10:45:49	sheep	uname -m tells you what architecture uname is running with
2019-07-05 10:46:02	jonascj	And of course `uname -m` could reveal you were on something not x86 at all (like ARM)
2019-07-05 10:47:14	jonascj	sheep: The manual says "-m: print machine hardware name", but maybe you are right, on a multilib system I could run a 32bit version of uname which would report x86 instead of x86_64
2019-07-05 10:48:27	jonascj	Still, isn't it pretty accepted that `uname -a` is the way to tell which kernel your system uses and which architecture that kernel is build for (and hence which architecture your machine uses)?

2019-07-05 10:51:59	sheep	actually I'm not sure which uname -m will report. it looks like uname in coreutils just uses the uname system call
2019-07-05 10:53:05	jonascj	it must report the arch the kernel is built for. The arch of the processor is found from info in /proc/cpuinfo, I think

2019-07-05 10:53:58	jonascj	so a 32bit linux (not relevant for archlinux any more) running on a x86_64 processor will report "i386", "x86" or similar with 'uname -m' I hope

2019-07-05 13:03:34	earnestly	The_archer_666: Generally either a port is open or it is not, and if it's open there's very little you can do except hope the software listening on it is robust enough.  Yeah you can limit stuff to certain networks which is fine.  Firewalls mostly exist to prevent random users of your network from starting software that opens ports (listens)
2019-07-05 13:04:08	earnestly	The_archer_666: The main role of a firewall, ignoring the traffic control bits, is to prevent information leaks (i.e. dropping everything you don't want)

2019-07-05 14:15:47	raster	shesmu: yes - tho doing your own distro would be pretty nutty given the amount of work. what would make mroe sense is to take arch and pin down REPOSITORIES to some "stable version" if you want that then only update what packages really need updates. but it's also then a lot fo work just doing those if its "security/bugfix only" for example... so you should consider what your larger goal is

2019-07-05 14:45:28	raster	i mean the real cost might be about 50k of code and the memory to load the icons use3d into memory (also maybe 50-200k)

2019-07-08 15:04:57	doux	Hi, I was using pacstrap yesterday, and I think it completed successfully, but it gave some sort of perl error/warning about locales being unset. This morning I searched the /usr/bin/pacstrap script for what command could have triggered that warning/error, but I can't find it.

2019-07-08 15:08:43	doux	rcf: ok, thanks. What part of the pacstrap script uses perl to check locales though?
2019-07-08 15:08:47	Foxfir3	jelle: thanks. I see It now. set the prefix in my shell, and global modules will sit neatly in my home folder, not messing with Arch updates.
2019-07-08 15:09:08	rcf	doux: might be something done by pacman itself. Think post-install scripts and hooks.

2019-07-08 16:54:50	Tom^	Lehthanis: also last i used optimus ages ago. you had to get things running on the onboard intel one, because the monitor is hardwired to it. so setting up X like this i assume makes it try to run on the nvidia gpu but no monitor is connected to it, and ploff blank screen.

2019-07-10 23:15:31	jol	Hello. I notice that packages with *.service files don't have installation hook functions to do `systemctl daemon-reload`. Does that mean that if a *.service file changes in an upgrade and one starts the service, the now-deleted *.service (the previous version) would be the one that's used unless one explicitely did `systemctl daemon-reload` after the use of pacman?
2019-07-10 23:15:34	grazzolini	hortiel: btw, this 128 bit passphrase you're mentioned already has a use, it's called password manager
2019-07-10 23:15:51	grazzolini	jol: there's a pacman hook to do that
2019-07-10 23:15:51	mcoffin	But that's inherently problematic. Any key that can be generated exactly the same way from the same source is only as secure as the source (at least in my understanding. I'm no cryptographer). Like take PKCS12 for AES keys. That's why IVs and salts exist, so that you're not using the same exact stuff every time you encrypt something with that key

2019-07-11 13:25:24	MrElendig	with pulse you can use set-default-sink  and an actual device name instead
2019-07-11 13:25:40	MrElendig	more and then use the default sink for everything

2019-07-11 16:29:06	vdl	in Canada the status of servers often change, it's kinda boring to update the mirrorlist manually here and there with https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?country=CA&protocol=https&ip_version=4&use_mirror_status=on
2019-07-11 16:29:21	vdl	Namarrgon: security flaw I guess?
2019-07-11 16:29:27	Namarrgon	pick a working non-canadian mirror
2019-07-11 16:29:38	Namarrgon	nothing to do with security

2019-07-11 16:35:40	rcf	vdl: the main issue with packaging the mirrorlist is that once you're on a mirror that decides to quit syncing, you would be getting the same outdated list that directed you to that mirror in the first place.

2019-07-12 13:04:27	Metalindustrien	I think the systemclock on my Arch Linux might be broken or something... every single TOTP password generated on the machine is wrong - both generated from 1Password and Bitwarden. Using the exact same accounts on my iPhone or home computer generates different, correct TOTP. Really weird. It's not critical since I still have my other devices (and yes, I know that ruins the point of 2FA)

2019-07-12 14:08:46	Toxmi	I think the dm-crypt+LUKS even if I type 3 times the password is better and even more reliable :D
2019-07-12 14:09:24	marinos	Toxmi: I think that's exactly what you are trying to do. use the keyfile only on the second harddisk. leave the root partition as is so it asks for password when it opens during boot. the rest should be mounted automaticaly

Normally shouldn't this be done after the login process ? If so, how is it possible that I want to start netctl service after my login.

2019-07-16 17:39:19	vanek	yeah me too. the problem is that i did not specify this module to be loaded for the device :) it auto loads on boot
2019-07-16 17:39:53	vanek	the module came with kernel 5.2 soooo there is a chance it is a problem with the module itself
2019-07-16 17:40:14	mgolisch	why do you think there is a problem?
2019-07-16 17:40:26	mgolisch	it just means lspci doesnt know the device class the device has
2019-07-16 17:40:26	vanek	coz it does not read the sd card, and shows up as unnasigned class ff00

2019-07-23 14:46:13	mrossinek	I just noticed that my arch server running on a raspberry pi is unable to resolve some domain names. For example it does work when pinging local IPs, or google, and even my ZNC server works correctly (since I am writing from a client connected to it from a different location). But it cannot resolve eg archlinux.org and fails to fetch updates. I only noticed since all timestamps from my ZNC playback are off
2019-07-23 14:46:14	mrossinek	7.5 hours.. Any ideas what could be the reason? I never had to deal with a non-working systemd-resolved service before so I have no real idea where to start. I did look at the output of resolvectl but don't really know what to look for..

2019-07-23 16:03:05	fishguts	I will try a resize and if that doesn't work recreate it as you suggest. FAT32 is the best option in this case. Thank you.
